'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by [[The University of Chicago|UChicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US' [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, &quot;brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008 Post Register: Idaho Falls, ID:. INL History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.gov/welcome.html Welcome to Argonne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.gov/about.html About Argonne]&lt;/ref&gt; These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the &quot;[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]&quot; at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the &quot;Metallurgical Laboratory&quot; was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for &quot;cooperative research in nucleonics.&quot; At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called &quot;Argonne-West,&quot; to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs to produce the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, &quot;[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]&quot; page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950-1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified &quot;hot zone&quot;. He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J. Edgar Hoover and Paul Harvey |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2010-01-23 |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012202602.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson &quot;Nels&quot; Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the &quot;Janus&quot; reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=argonne+surveyor+5#v=onepage&amp;q=argonne%20surveyor%205&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

*'''Hard X-ray Sciences''': Argonne is home to one of the world’s largest high-energy light sources: the [[Advanced Photon Source]] (APS). Each year, scientists make thousands of discoveries while using the APS to characterize both [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[Inorganic compound|inorganic materials]] and even processes, such as how vehicle [[fuel injector]]s spray gasoline in engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = New X-ray technique may lead to better, cleaner fuel injectors for automobiles |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |date = 2008-02-19 |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2008/news080219.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Leadership Computing''': Argonne maintains one of the fastest computers for open science, the [[IBM]] [[Blue Gene/Q]] [[supercomputer]], and has developed system software for these massive machines. Argonne works to drive the evolution of leadership computing from [[petascale]] to [[exascale computing|exascale]], develop new codes and computing environments, and expand computational efforts to help solve scientific challenges. For example, in October 2009, the laboratory announced that it would be embarking on a joint project to explore [[cloud computing]] for scientific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = DOE to explore scientific cloud computing at Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |date = 2009-10-14 |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2009/news091014a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s Argonne translated the ''[[Numerische Mathematik]]'' numerical linear algebra programs from [[Algol]] to [[Fortran]] and this library was expanded into [[LINPACK]] and [[EISPACK]], by [[Cleve Moler]], et al.
*'''Materials for Energy''': Argonne scientists work to predict, understand, and control where and how to place individual atoms and molecules to achieve desired material properties. Among other innovations, Argonne scientists helped develop an ice slurry to cool the organs of heart attack victims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Gupta |first = Manya |title = Medical care on ice |publisher = Medill Reports |date = 2009-11-10 |url = http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=145701}}&lt;/ref&gt; described what makes diamonds slippery at the [[nanoscale]] level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Engineers reveal what makes diamonds slippery at the nanoscale |publisher = Science Centric |date = 2008-06-26 |url = http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08062610}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered a [[superinsulator|superinsulating]] material that resists the flow of electric current more completely than any other previous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Newly discovered 'superinsulators' promise to transform materials research, electronics design |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |date = 2008-04-04 |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2008/MSD080404.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Electrical Energy Storage''': Argonne develops [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] for [[electric transportation technology]] [[Electrical grid|grid]] storage for intermittent [[energy]] sources like [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar energy|solar]], and the manufacturing processes for these materials-intensive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Mandel |first = Jenny |title = Chemistry Change in Batteries Could Make for Safer Electric Cars |publisher = New York Times |date = 2009-08-24 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/08/24/24greenwire-chemistry-change-in-batteries-could-make-for-s-34626.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laboratory has been working on advanced battery research and development for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Building better batteries |publisher = U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate = 2009-12-13 |url = http://www.energy.gov/discovery/building_better_batteries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 10 years, the laboratory has focused on [[lithium-ion batteries]], and in September 2009, it announced an initiative to explore and improve their capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne opens new chapter in battery research: Li-Air |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |date = 2009-09-15 |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2009/batteries090915.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne also maintains an independent battery-testing facility, which tests sample batteries from both government and private industry to see how well they perform over time and under heat and cold stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Battery Test Facility |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory, Transportation Center |accessdate = 2009-12-13 |url = http://www.transportation.anl.gov/facilities/battery_lab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alternative Energy and Efficiency''': Argonne develops both [[Chemical fuel|chemical]] and [[biofuel|biological]] [[fuel]]s tailored for current engines as well as improved [[Internal combustion engine|combustion]] schemes for future engine technologies. The laboratory has also recommended best practices for conserving fuel; for example, a study that recommended installing auxiliary cab heaters for trucks in lieu of idling the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Leavitt |first = Wendy |title = Not Just Idle Talk |publisher = Fleet Owner |date = 1998-08-01 |url = http://fleetowner.com/mag/fleet_not_idle_talk_2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[solar energy]] research program focuses on solar-fuel and solar-electric devices and systems that are scalable and economically competitive with fossil energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne, Northwestern seek ANSER to solar energy challenges |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |date = 2007-05-08 |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2007/news070509.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne scientists also explore best practices for a [[smart grid]], both by modeling power flow between utilities and homes and by researching the technology for interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Grid Research: Making the Grid Smarter |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory Transportation Center |date = 2009-08-01 |url = http://www.transportation.anl.gov/smart_grid/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Nuclear Energy''': Argonne generates advanced reactor and [[fuel cycle]] technologies that enable the safe, sustainable generation of [[nuclear power]]. Argonne scientists develop and validate computational models and reactor simulations of future generation [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Putting the new in nuclear |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory magazine |date = Fall 2009 |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/headlines/frontiers-fall09.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another project studies how to reprocess [[spent nuclear fuel]], so that waste is reduced up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Science Channel |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMhruDLNwBI |title=Doing the impossible: Recycling nuclear waste |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Biological and Environmental Systems''': Understanding the local effect of climate change requires integration of the interactions between the environment and human activities.

It has since expanded both the genres it screens and the activities it sponsors.

==History==
Doc Films began in 1932 as the Documentary Film Group, as the students involved collected money to foot the bill for screening documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The film snob's dictionary: an essential lexicon of filmological knowledge | last = Kamp | first = David |author2=Lawrence Levi | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7679-1876-2 | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Educational Film Library Association, American Film Center. &quot;The group first pooled funds informally to screen documentaries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, it officially became the International House Documentary Film Group&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/dev/about/ | title = About Doc Films | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1950, when an auditorium was in use for screening films, was already being hailed as &quot;probably the oldest U.S. film society&quot; by ''Film News''.&lt;ref name=FilmNews/&gt;

==Activities==
As the student organizers realized that they could not sustain the organization on documentaries alone, they expanded to incorporate [[Fictional film|fictional]] and [[experimental film]]s. While the University's classes are in session, Doc Films hosts nightly screenings of films selected from one of these categories at Max Palevsky Cinema, located in [[Ida Noyes Hall]]. Doc's screening selection is eclectic. Each quarter of the academic year, students and members of the public propose series of ten films that are somehow related to each other (filmmaker, actor, language, genre, era, theme, etc.). The Programming Committee, which consists of any interested students or members of the public, then chooses among these proposals to schedule a different series for each weeknight (Sunday through Friday).  Recent films, normally delayed one quarter from their nationwide release date, are shown on weekends. Occasionally, Doc screens films which have not yet been released to the general public in the area, including ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. The goings on of the theater are also completely run by volunteers, being students or interested members of the community. These volunteers collect tickets, present films, and project film.

Other events include showings of student films and conversations with faculty and professionals connected to the film industry. It has hosted a number of film directors, including [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Woody Allen]] and [[John Ford]].

[[File:Eckhart Hall.jpg|thumb|Eckhart Hall at the University of Chicago was used for the Metallurgical Project's administrative offices]]
The '''Metallurgical Laboratory''' or &quot;Met Lab&quot; was the [[Chicago]]-based part of the [[Manhattan Project]] – the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to develop the [[atomic bomb]] during [[World War II]]. It was part of the Metallurgical Project headed by [[Arthur H. Compton]], a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate and Professor of Physics at the [[University of Chicago]], the objective of which was to create an atomic bomb using [[plutonium]]. The Metallurgical Laboratory was established in February 1942. It produced the first controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]] on 2 December 1942 in [[Chicago Pile-1]], built at the University's old [[American football|football]] stadium, [[Stagg Field]]. In August 1942 its chemical section was the first to chemically separate a weighable sample of plutonium.

The world's first nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1, was soon moved by the lab to a more remote site in the [[Red Gate Woods|Argonne Forest]], where its original materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2. Another reactor, [[Chicago Pile-3]], was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use [[heavy water]] as a neutron moderator. It went [[critical mass|critical]] in May 1944, and was first operated at full power in July 1944. The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]] in the [[state of Washington]].

In addition to the work on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the chemistry and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the [[Bismuth phosphate process]] used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.

The Metallurgical Laboratory was successively led by Richard L. Doan, [[Samuel K. Allison]], [[Joyce C. Stearns]] and [[Farrington Daniels]]. Scientists who worked there included [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Glenn Seaborg]]. At its peak on 1 July 1944, the Metallurgical Laboratory had 2,008 staff. By 1 July 1945, this had declined to 1,444. The Metallurgical Laboratory became [[Argonne National Laboratory]] on 1 July 1946.

At [[Columbia University]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Leo Szilard]] began exploring how this might be achieved.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=8–10}} Szilard drafted a [[Einstein–Szilard letter|confidential letter]] to the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], warning of the possibility of a [[German nuclear weapon project]], and convinced his old friend and collaborator [[Albert Einstein]] to co-sign it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = The Atomic Heritage Foundation| first = | title = Einstein's Letter to Franklin D.

In April 1941, the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), asked [[Arthur Compton]], a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the [[University of Chicago]], to report on the uranium program.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=36–38}} [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] theorized that heavy isotopes with odd [[atomic number]]s were [[fissile]]. If so, then [[plutonium-239]] was likely to be.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}} [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Glenn Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the [[thermal neutron]] capture [[Neutron cross section|cross section]] of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=192–193}} Compton conferred with [[Eugene Wigner]] from [[Princeton University]] about how plutonium might be produced in a [[nuclear reactor]], and with [[Robert Serber]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

On 20 December, soon after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] that brought the United States into the war, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=72–73}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=50–51}} Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}}  Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts. It fell to Compton to decide which of these should be pursued.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=180–181}} He proposed an ambitious schedule that aimed to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a deliverable atomic bomb by January 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California created too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided to concentrate the work at his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} whereas Columbia was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts and was hesitant to add another secret project.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=88}} Other factors contributing to the decision were Chicago's central location and the availability of  scientists, technicians and facilities in the [[Midwest]] that had not yet been taken away by war work.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} Housing was more readily available, and an inland city was less vulnerable to enemy attack.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=80}}

==Personnel==
[[File:HD.30.502 (10443872285).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arthur H. Compton]] (left) the head of the Metallurgical Project, with [[Martin D. Whitaker]], the director of Clinton Laboratories]]
The new research establishment was formed in February 1942, and named the &quot;Metallurgical Laboratory&quot; or &quot;Met Lab&quot;. Although some real metallurgy would eventually be carried out, the name was intended as a cover for its activities. The University of Chicago had been considering establishing a research institute into metals, and indeed would do so after the war, so its creation attracted little attention. Compton's plutonium project then became known as the Metallurgical Project.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=82}} The Metallurgical Laboratory was administered by the University of Chicago under contract to the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD).{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=S2}}

Over 5,000 people in 70 research groups participated in Compton's Metallurgical Project,{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=83}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=636}} also known as the &quot;Pile&quot; or &quot;X-10&quot; Project,{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947a|pp=S2-S5, 1.1}} of whom some 2,000 worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=83}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=636}} Despite offering good salaries, recruiting was difficult. There was competition for scientists and engineers from other defense-related projects, and Chicago was expensive compared with university towns.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=24–25}}

[[Norman Hilberry]] was associate director of the Metallurgical Project, and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the Metallurgical Laboratory.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=83}} While Doan was an able administrator, he had difficulty with being accepted as the head of the laboratory, since he was not an academic. On 5 May 1943, Compton replaced him with [[Samuel K. Allison]], and appointed [[Henry D. Smyth]] as associate director.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=25}} Initially there were three physics groups, which were headed by Allison, Fermi and [[Martin D. Whitaker]]. [[Frank Spedding]] was in charge of the Chemistry Division. He was later succeeded by [[Herbert Newby McCoy|Herbert McCoy]], and then by [[James Franck]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=83}} Compton placed [[Robert Oppenheimer]] in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942. In November 1942, this became a separate project, known as [[Los Alamos Laboratory|Project Y]], which was located in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=127–131}}

After the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] took over the Manhattan Project in August 1942, the [[Manhattan District]] coordinated the work.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=2.1}} From 17 February 1943, Compton reported directly to the director of the Manhattan Project, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], instead of the OSRD [[S-1 Section]]. {{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=21–22}} The Manhattan District assumed full responsibility for the Metallurgical Laboratory contract on 1 May 1943.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=2.1}} [[Captain (O-3)|Captain]] J. F. Grafton was appointed the Chicago Area Engineer in August 1942. He was succeeded by Captain [[Arthur V. Peterson]] in December 1942. Peterson remained until October 1944. Captain J. F. McKinley became Chicago Area Engineer on 1 July 1945.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=7.2}}

==Buildings==
At first, most of the Laboratory office space was provided by the University of Chicago. The physicists took over space under the North and West Stands of [[Stagg Field]] and in the Service Building, where there was a cyclotron. The chemists took over the [[George Herbert Jones Laboratory]] and the Kent Chemical Laboratory. The health group took over space in the Anatomy Building, Drexel House, Billings Hospital and the Killis Laboratory and the administrative offices went into [[Eckhart Hall]].{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=2.3–2.5}} Szilard later wrote that &quot;the morale of the scientists could almost be plotted in a graph by counting the number of lights burning after dinner in the offices at Eckhart Hall.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Leo Szilard: His Version of the Facts |issn=0096-3402 |accessdate=18 December 2015 |volume=35 |issue=4 |date=April 1979 |p=32 |author1=Educational Foundation For Nuclear Science |first1=Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the project outgrew its accommodation in Eckhart Hall, it moved into the nearby Ryerson Hall. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually occupied {{convert|205000|sqft}} of campus space. About $131,000 worth of alterations were made to buildings occupied by the laboratory but the University of Chicago also had to make alterations for users displaced by it.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=2.3–2.5}}

[[File:Argonne Laboratory.jpg|thumb|left|Argonne Laboratory at the original site]]
The University of Chicago made a {{convert|0.73|acre|ha|adj=on}} site occupied by tennis courts available to the Manhattan District on a one dollar lease, for the construction of a new chemistry building with {{convert|20000|sqft}} of space. [[Stone and Webster]] commenced work on this in September 1942 and it was completed in December. It was soon found to be too small and an adjacent {{convert|0.85|acres|ha|adj=on}} plot was added to the lease, on which a {{convert|30000|sqft|adj=on}} annex was built and completed in November 1943. Extensive work was then carried out on the ventilation system to allow the laboratory to work with plutonium more safely. A site containing an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]] and stables owned by the University in Chicago was made available in April 1943. Known as Site B, it was remodeled to provide {{convert|62670|sqft}} of laboratories and workshops for the health and metallurgy groups. The 124th Field Artillery Armory was leased from the state of Illinois to provide more space in March 1944 and about {{convert|360000|sqft}} of space was leased or built, at a cost of $2 million.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=2.7–2.8}}

For reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities for experiments with nuclear reactors in densely-populated Chicago.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=46–47}} Compton selected a site in the [[Red Gate Woods|Argonne Forest]], part of the [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County]], about {{convert|20|mi}} southwest of Chicago, which became known as Site A.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=46–47}} The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] leased {{convert|1088|acres}} of land there from [[Cook County]] for the duration of the war plus one year for a dollar. Construction of facilities including laboratories and service buildings and an access road was commenced in September 1942 and completed in early 1943.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=2.6}} Compton appointed Fermi as the first director of the Argonne Laboratory.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=21–22}}

==Reactor development==

===Chicago Pile-1===
[[File:HD.5A.013 (10692501095).jpg|right|thumb|Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. The stadium was razed in 1957.]]
Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental reactors (known at the time as &quot;piles&quot;) under the Stagg Field stands.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=91}} Fermi designed a new uranium and [[graphite]] pile that could be brought to [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] in a controlled, self-sustaining [[nuclear reaction]].{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=429}} Construction at Argonne fell behind schedule due to Stone &amp; Webster's difficulty recruiting enough skilled workers and obtaining the required building materials. This led to an industrial dispute, with union workers downing tools over the recruitment of non-union labor.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=15}} When it became clear that the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed, Compton approved a proposal from Fermi to build the pile under the stands at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}

Construction of the reactor, known as [[Chicago Pile-1]], began on the morning of 16 November 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under [[Walter Zinn]] and a night shift under [[Herbert L. Anderson]].{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=91–92}} When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} high, {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} wide at the ends and {{convert|25|ft}} across the middle.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}} It contained {{convert|6|ST}} of uranium metal, {{convert|50|ST}} of uranium oxide and {{convert|400|ST}} of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=16–17}} On 2 December 1942, it achieved the first controlled self-sustaining nuclear reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-1 Goes Critical&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/cp-1_critical.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122183641/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/cp-1_critical.htm |archivedate=22 November 2010 |title=CP-1 Goes Critical |publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1942 CP-1's power output was increased to 200&amp;nbsp;W, enough to power a light bulb; but lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity. Thereafter, testing was continued, but at the lower power of 0.5&amp;nbsp;W.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=3.9}}

===Chicago Pile-2===
The operation of Chicago Pile-1 was terminated on 28 February 1943. It was dismantled and moved to Argonne,{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=23}}&lt;ref name=&quot;cp1anl&quot;&gt;

It was surrounded by concrete walls {{convert|5|ft}} thick that acted as a [[radiation shield]], and with overhead protection from {{convert|6|in|cm}} of lead and {{convert|50|in|cm}} of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained {{convert|52|ST}} of uranium and {{convert|472|ST}} of graphite.

===Chicago Pile-3===
A second reactor, known as [[Chicago Pile-3]], or CP-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use [[heavy water]] as a neutron moderator, something that had been unavailable when CP-1 was built but which was now becoming available in quantity thanks to the Manhattan Project's [[P-9 Project]].{{sfn|Waltham|2002|pp=8–9}} The reactor was a large aluminum tank, {{convert|6|ft}} in diameter, which was filled with heavy water, which weighed about {{convert|6.5|ST}}. The cover was pierced by regularly-spaced holes through which 121 uranium rods sheathed in aluminum projected into the heavy water. The tank was surrounded by a graphite [[neutron reflector]], which in turn was surrounded by a lead shield, and by concrete. Shielding on the top of the reactor consisted of layers of {{convert|1|ft|cm}} square removable bricks composed of layers of iron and [[masonite]]. The heavy water was cooled with a water-cooled [[heat exchanger]]. In addition to the control rods, there was an emergency mechanism for dumping the heavy water into a tank below.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.13–3.14}} Construction began on 1 January 1944.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=26}} The reactor went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power of 300&amp;nbsp;kW in July 1944.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.13–3.14}}

During the war Zinn allowed it to be run around the clock, and its design made it easy to conduct experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;waste&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/03/05/the-way-things-work-nuclear-waste/ |title=The Way Things Work: Nuclear waste |newspaper=The Chicago Maroon |date=5 March 2009 |first=Claire |last=McNear  |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as [[tritium]] and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine [[thermal stability]] of materials, and to train operators.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.13–3.14}}{{sfn|Wattenberg|1975|p=173}}

===Production piles===
The design of the reactors for plutonium production involved a number of problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=2.6–2.7}} Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a geometric configuration called a &quot;lattice&quot;.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.4–3.5}} By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, and so was chosen for CP-1, and subsequently for the production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen on the basis of its availability compared with [[beryllium]] or heavy water.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.9–3.11}}

[[File:Argonne history Chicago Pile-3.jpg|thumb|left|Chicago Pile-3]]
The decision of what coolant should be used attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was [[helium]], because it could be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, and it would have to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to [[DuPont]], the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=3.14–3.15}}

In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that included [[Alvin Weinberg]], [[Katharine Way]], Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and [[Edward Creutz]] produced a design for a production reactor with water cooling.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=217–218}} The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=22–24}}

The design used a thin layer of aluminum to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=167}} After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=3.16}} In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Edward Chester Creutz 1913–2009 |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/creutz-edward.pdf |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2010 |location=Washington, D.C. |first=George |last=Hinman |first2=David |last2=Rose |series=Biographical Memoirs |accessdate=March 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of water as a coolant raised the problem of corrosion and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute [[sulfuric acid]] was added to the water to give it a [[pH]] of 6.5. Other additives such as [[sodium silicate]], [[sodium dichromate]] and [[oxalic acid]]  were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=4.5–4.7}} The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from [[corrosion]] that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive [[fission products]] that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons.{{sfn|Smyth|1945|pp=146–147}} The aluminum canning process was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=4.5–4.7}}

An important area of research concerned the [[Wigner effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1707653 | title = Theoretical Physics in the Metallurgical Laboratory of Chicago | year = 1946 | last1 = Wigner | first1 = E. P. |authorlink=Eugene Wigner | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 857|bibcode = 1946JAP....17..857W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|pp=5.1–5.2}} Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=213–215}}

==Chemistry and metallurgy==
[[File:Laboratory - New Chemistry Building.jpg|thumb|right|Laboratory at the New Chemistry Building at the University of Chicago]]
Metallurgical work concentrated on uranium and plutonium. Despite being discovered over a century before, little was known about uranium, as evidenced by the fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly {{convert|500|F}}. Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range, uranium could be hammered and rolled, and drawn into the rods required by the production reactor design. It was found that when uranium was cut, the shavings would burst into flame. Working with [[Alcoa]] and [[General Electric]], the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=175}}

That the metallurgy of plutonium was completely unknown came as no surprise at all, for it had only recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory.&lt;ref name = &quot;seaborg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = History of MET Lab Section C-I, April 1942 – April 1943 |publisher = University of California, Berkeley Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory |doi = 10.2172/7110621 |authorlink = Glenn T. Seaborg |year = 1977 |last1 = Seaborg |first1 = G.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=14}} Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=176}} The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the [[Bismuth phosphate process]] used to separate plutonium from uranium.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=26}}

==Health and safety==
The dangers of radiation poisoning had become well-known due to the experience of the [[radium dial painters]]. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with [[Ernest Lawrence]] at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the [[Hanford Site]]. Groves appointed [[Stafford L. Warren]] from the [[University of Rochester]] as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=180–181}}

The Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set standards for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but this could be too late. Personal [[quartz fiber dosimeter]]s were procured, as were [[film badge dosimeter]]s, which recorded cumulative dosage.{{sfn|Hacker|1987|pp=34–37}} Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable [[Geiger counter]]s. [[Herbert Parker (scientist)|Herbert M. Parker]] created a metric for radiation exposure he called the [[roentgen equivalent man]] or rem. After the war, this replaced the [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] as the standard measure of radiation exposure.{{sfn|Hacker|1987|pp=40–42}} Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium [[wikt:semi-works|semiworks]] at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] began producing it in 1943. The project set a limit of 5 μg in the body, and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified to ensure that this standard was met.{{sfn|Hacker|1987|pp=53–55}}

==Later activities==
During 1943 and 1944, the Metallurgical Laboratory focused on getting first the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at the Clinton Engineer Works, and then the [[B Reactor]] at the Hanford Site up and running. By the end of 1944, the focus had switched to training operators. Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943,{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=26}} and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944, particularly Hanford and Los Alamos. Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944, and Zinn became the director of the Argonne Laboratory. Allison followed in November 1944, taking with him a substantial number of the Metallurgical Laboratory's staff, including most of the instrument section. He was replaced by [[Joyce C. Stearns]].{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=29–30}} [[Farrington Daniels]],{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=7.1}} who became associate director on 1 September 1944,{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=29–30}} succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=35}}

Where possible, the University of Chicago attempted to re-employ workers who had been transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once that work had ended.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=25}} Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 percent or more of their staff.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=29–30}} From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=7.2}}

The end of the war did not end the flow of departures. Glenn Seaborg left on 17 May 1946, taking much of what remained of the chemistry division with him. On 11 February 1946, the Army reached an agreement with University President [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]] for the staff and equipment of the Metallurgical Project to be taken over by a regional laboratory based at Argonne, which the university still manages.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=40}} On 1 July 1946, the Metallurgical Laboratory became [[Argonne National Laboratory]], the first designated National Laboratory,&lt;ref name=&quot;How&quot;/&gt; with Zinn as its first director.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=46}}  The new laboratory had 1,278 staff on 31 December 1946,{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947b|p=7.1}} when the Manhattan Project ended, and responsibility for the national laboratories passed to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]],{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=600}}  which replaced the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=394–398}} The work of the Metallurgical Laboratory also led to the founding of the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], as well as the [[James Franck Institute]], at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;How&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/features/how_the_first_chain_reaction_changed_science/ |accessdate=19 December 2015 |first=Steve |last=Koppes |title=How the First Chain Reaction Changed Science|publisher=The University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the United States government began cleaning up the old Manhattan Project sites under the [[Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program]] (FUSRAP). This included those used by the Metallurgical Laboratory. Stagg Field had been demolished in 1957, but 23 locations in Kent Laboratory were decontaminated in 1977, and another 99 at the Eckhart, Ryerson, and the Jones Laboratory in 1984. About {{convert|600|cuft}} of solid and three [[55-gallon drum]]s of liquid waste were collected and shipped to various sites for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Chicago Maroon |title=The Way Things Work: Nuclear waste |url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/03/05/the-way-things-work-nuclear-waste/ |date=5 March 2009 |first=Claire |last=McNear |accessdate=13 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atomic Energy Commission terminated its lease on the Armory site in 1951, and it was restored to the state of Illinois. Testing in 1977, 1978 and 1987 indicated residual levels of radioactivity that exceeded [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] guidelines, so decontamination was carried out in 1988 and 1989, after which the site was declared suitable for unrestricted use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/05/f0/FUSRAP%20Stakeholder%20Report_1.pdf |title=FUSRAP Stakeholder Report |date=May 2013 |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |accessdate=13 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Midway Plaisance''', known locally as '''the Midway''', is a [[Chicago parks|Chicago public park]] on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#South side|South Side]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]].  It is one mile long by 220 yards wide and extends along 59th and 60th streets, joining [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] at its east end and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] at its west end. It divides the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] to the north from the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] community area to the south, 6 miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) south of the downtown &quot;[[Chicago Loop|Loop]]&quot;, near [[Lake Michigan]]. Today, the Midway runs through the southern portion of the [[University of Chicago]] campus, with university and related buildings fronting it on both sides.

It early came to prominence when it hosted [[amusement park|amusements]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, lending the name &quot;Midway&quot; to areas at [[county fair|county]] and [[state fair]]s with [[sideshow]]s.  Laid out with long vistas and [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of trees at the start of the 20th century, the Midway in part followed the vision of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], one of the creators of [[New York City]]'s famous [[Central Park]], but without his impracticable dream of creating a [[Venice#Transport|Venetian canal]] linking the lagoon systems of Jackson and Washington parks.  Instead, the Midway is landscaped with a [[ha-ha|fosse]] or dry ditch where the canal would have been.

Later designers and artists added (or sought to add) their vision to the Midway. A pet project of the University of Chicago and almost a part of its campus, it has remained essentially a green area.

==Origin of the name==
[[Image:Masaryk EquChi1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A view of the Memorial to [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] by [[Albin Polasek]] on the Midway.]]
The word &quot;plaisance&quot; is both the [[French language|French]] spelling of and a quaint obsolete spelling for &quot;pleasance&quot;, itself an obscure word in this context meaning &quot;a pleasure ground laid out with shady walks, trees and shrubs, statuary, and ornamental water&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==The South Park Commission plan==
[[File:Woodlawn Streetmap Image.png|thumb|350px|Maps showing the Midway Plaisance (black rectangle) between [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] to the west (left) and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. ([[Chicago Park District]] is in green, [[University of Chicago]] in yellow background)]]
The Midway Plaisance began as a vision in the 1850s of [[Paul Cornell (Chicago)|Paul Cornell]], a land developer, to turn an undeveloped stretch of infertile land south of Chicago into an urban lakeside retreat for middle- and upper-class residents seeking to escape city life. The area was a lakefront [[marsh]] [[ecosystem]].

In 1869, Cornell and his South Park Commission were granted the right to set up a complex of parks and boulevards that would include Washington Park to the west, Jackson Park to the east on the lakeshore, and the Midway Plaisance as a system of paths and waterways connecting the two (see [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3309.html Encyclopedia of Chicago Map]). The firm of Olmsted, Vaux, and Co., famous for creating New York City's [[Central Park]], was hired to design the urban oasis. Part of their plan was that the Midway would function as &quot;a magnificent chain of lakes&quot;, allowing boaters to go from the ponds to be built in Washington Park to the lagoons to be developed in Jackson Park and through the lagoons to Lake Michigan.

The South Park Commission office, where all the detailed plans were stored, was burned in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. The expense of rebuilding the city eliminated the funds to cover expenditures that the plans would have entailed, and the South Park area remained largely in its natural swampy state.

==World's Columbian Exposition==
The [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 was held in the underdeveloped parts of the South Park. The worldwide celebration of  [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' transfer of &quot;the torch of civilization to the New World&quot; in 1492 was one of the most successful and influential of [[world's fair]]s.  It covered over 600 acres (2.4&amp;nbsp;km²) and attracted exhibitors and visitors from all over the world.

For the Exposition, the mile-long Midway Plaisance, running from the eastern edge of Washington Park on [[Cottage Grove Avenue]] to the western edge of Jackson Park on [[Stony Island Avenue]], was turned over to the theatrical entrepreneur [[Sol Bloom]], a protégé of Chicago mayor [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]] It became a grand mix of fakes, [[hokum]], and the genuinely educational and introduced the &quot;hootchy-cootchy&quot; version of the [[belly dance]] in the &quot;Street in Cairo&quot; amusement; it was the most popular, with 2.25 million admissions. [[George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.]]'s original [[Ferris Wheel]] carried over 1.5 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SkFQ5tgWKfEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ferris+wheels:+an+illustrated+history&amp;cd=1 Ferris wheels - an illustrated history, Norman D. Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt; The Midway's money-making concessions and sideshows made over $4 million in 1893 dollars, and it was the more memorable portion of the Exposition for many visitors.

In the years after the Exposition closed, &quot;[[Midway (fair)|midway]]&quot; came to be used in the United States to signify the area for amusements at a county or [[state fair]], [[circus]], or [[amusement park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=midway|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midway|work=Chicago Manual Style (CMS)|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midway Plaisance represented Africans as cannibals and other races as inferior and primitive. The organization of the expo led visitors from the Midway Plaisance to the Women's Building and then to the White City. It was used to show the dominance of American expansion and the white race. &lt;ref&gt;http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma96/WCE/legacy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Chicago==
[[Image:MidwayView1.JPG|left|200px|thumb|Spires of [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] buildings of [[The University of Chicago]] campus overlooking the tree-lined, grassy Midway Plaisance; view looking northeast.]]
[[Image:LinneStatueMidway.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Linne statue on University of Chicago campus]]

Following the Exposition, the Midway Plaisance was returned to a park setting, under the renewed plans of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. Over the ensuing decades, the Midway gradually came to be a part of the [[University of Chicago]], which expanded in 1926 to be located on either side of it. Later designers and artists, including [[Lorado Taft]], and [[Eero Saarinen]] added or sought to add their vision to the Midway. Statues of the father of modern [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[Carl Linnaeus]], and an [[equestrian statue]] of the Knight of Blanik, a legendary [[Czech Republic|Czech]] savior who emerges from [[Blaník]] mountain in his nation's hour of need by famed sculptor [[Albin Polasek]], grace the Midway.

It has remained essentially a green area, a public resource subject to much speculation, and various periodic plans of redevelopment. The sunken panels, home now to [[soccer]] players and a new [[ice skating]] and sports facility, the cross-street &quot;bridges&quot;, and the east–west lines of trees, pay homage to Olmsted's vision.

In 1999, a new master plan for the Midway Plaisance done by [[OLIN]], a [[landscape architecture]] firm, was unveiled by the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Chicago Park District]].

The proximity of the Midway to the University gave the school's early [[American football|football]] teams, the Maroons, a second nickname, &quot;[[Monsters of the Midway]]&quot;, a name later applied to the [[Chicago Bears]] when the University of Chicago dropped its football program. The program has since been reinstated, and the Maroons play at [[Stagg Field]] on 55th street, half a mile north of the midway.

The '''Quadrangle Club''' is the name of a membership club at the [[University of Chicago]].  It is located at 1155 East 57th Street (the southeast corner of 57th Street and University Avenue) in [[Chicago]]. It has a full-service dining room, a bar, several lounges, and sleeping quarters for members and/or their guests. It has 17 sleeping rooms, including 5 suites with an extra sitting room. It is one of the few locations in the city of [[Chicago]] that has [[Har-Tru]] (clay) [[tennis]] courts.

== History ==
The Quadrangle Club was created in 1893 as a social club for the faculty of the newly established University of Chicago.  It was to be a place to gather for &quot;study, socialization, and especially communication,&quot; and from its inception was open to members of the community as well as to faculty.  It was spearheaded by Robert Francis Harper, an associate professor of Near Eastern Languages and the younger brother of William Rainey Harper, first president of the university.  It originally occupied a suite in the Barry Hotel, located at 59th Street between Dorchester and Blackstone.

By 1895, the club had outgrown the hotel suite, and land was purchased for the construction of a club house on the southeast corner of 58th and University, the current site of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]].  The new club house opened in 1896 and contained billiard and card rooms, a gymnasium, some sleeping rooms, and a small ladies' room for the wives of members.  Outside, to the south, there were tennis courts.  The Club hosted many social events, including lectures, recitals, and dances.  As an afterthought, a small dining room and basement kitchen were added to the building.  In 1897, fires led to modifications of the building by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]], a distinguished architect who later designed the building that the club currently occupies.

In 1916, to make way for [[Rockefeller Chapel]], the Quadrangle Club agreed to relocate to a parcel of land on the corner of 57th Street and University Avenue, the present site.  Howard Van Doren Shaw designed the new building, which opened on December 21, 1922.  Shaw designed a building resembling an [[English country house]], with large open spaces and—on the second floor, facing the tennis courts—abundant natural light.  In the summer of 1929, the old club house was moved (in two pieces) two blocks west to 956–960 East 58th Street, where it was renamed Ingleside Hall. 

The Quadrangle Club enjoyed a golden age during the 1920s and 1930s when it functioned as a popular gentleman's club offering billiards, a card room, and stimulating lunchtime conversation.  The &quot;Round Table&quot;, a lunchtime tradition in which professors from diverse fields gathered to share ideas, flourished.

As [[World War II]] came to an end the Quad Club found itself redefined by the changes in the times.  There was pressure to admit all faculty, including women professors.  The decline of the South Side of Chicago and the attractiveness of suburban living to some faculty decreased the potential membership.  It lost many amenities of the gentleman's club as financial pressures forced rooms to be taken over for catering affairs.  The Club has always kept its dues and fees low to accommodate faculty members with modest incomes, and catering helped to make up the inevitable deficits.

== Relationship with the university ==
The Quadrangle Club's relationship with the university has varied over the years as the club tried to accommodate both &quot;town&quot; and &quot;gown&quot;, but it has always been close. In part to facilitate needed repairs to the building, the university took formal control of the club in April 2007.  In exchange, the university promised to rehabilitate the building and maintain the club's commitment to its members through the hiring of the outside management company Flik Conference Centers, a division of Compass Group's North American Division. In 2011 outside management services were transferred from Flik to Restaurant Associates, another division of the Compass Group.  

While the Quadrangle Club is the University of Chicago's faculty club, university staff, parents, and neighbors are welcome to join. Roughly one quarter of the club's membership are not University of Chicago faculty or staff.

Designed by architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] between 1918 and 1924, and built between 1925 and 1928 without the use of structural steel, it contains about 70 integrated figural sculptures by sculptors [[Lee Lawrie]] and [[Ulric Ellerhusen]], and interior work by mosaicist [[Hildreth Meiere]]. Today the chapel is used for ecumenical worship services, weddings, university convocations, guest speakers, musical programs, and occasional film screenings. It occupies most of a block and can seat 1700 people.

The woodcarvings that adorn the organ and South balcony were created by [[Alois Lang]], a Master Woodcarver at the [[American Seating]] Co., and one of the artists responsible for bringing the medieval art of ecclesiastical carving back to life. His pieces in Rockefeller Chapel are carved from White Appalachian Oak.

==Carillon==
The chapel contains the [[Laura Celestia Spelman|Laura Spelman Rockefeller]] Memorial [[Carillon]] and tower, a separate gift from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] in 1932 in honor of his mother. This 72-bell carillon is the second-largest carillon in the world by mass, after the carillon at [[Riverside Church]] on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[New York City]], which Rockefeller Jr. also donated in honor of his mother.

[[File:57th Street Books.jpg|thumb|57th Street Books]]
'''Seminary Cooperative Bookstores, Inc.''', founded in 1961,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; is a [[cooperative]] [[bookstore]] with three branches in [[Chicago]]. Its flagship, known colloquially as the '''Seminary Co-op''' or simply the '''Sem Co-op''', is located at 5751 S. Woodlawn Avenue.  Prior to October 2012, it was located a block away in the basement of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]], next to the campus of the [[University of Chicago]], and stocked the largest selection of academic volumes in the [[United States]] throughout an extensive maze of shelves.&lt;ref name=&quot;seminary&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Seminary Co-op Bookstore | publisher=Metromix | url=http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/27594,0,2064020.venue | accessdate=2006-09-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060522153707/http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/search/27594,0,2064020.venue &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Co-op also operates 57th Street Books, also in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois|Hyde Park]] neighborhood, which stocks popular volumes, and the [[Newberry Library]] Bookstore, which sells books, cards, and gifts on Chicago's North Side. The Seminary Cooperative Bookstores sell shares of stock for $10 each; a purchase of three shares constitutes a membership, which provides a 10% discount.  Profits are typically reinvested into the Co-op's reserve funds, as distribution of profits would be negligible.

The Co-op's reputation was so great that [[Columbia University]] invited manager Jack Cella to either open a branch in New York City or leave and open a new store there. Until the university gained its own neighborhood academic bookstore in the late 1990s, many Columbia scholars ordered books from the Co-op.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott19970217&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/17/nyregion/columbia-nurtures-a-major-bookstore-for-serious-scholars.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title=Columbia Nurtures A Major Bookstore For Serious Scholars | work=The New York Times | date=1997-02-17 | accessdate=July 12, 2012 | author=Scott, Janny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Co-op has over 53,000 members, 3,500 of whom are located overseas.  The following countries have at least 100 members: Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Australia.  The following countries have at least 50 members: Taiwan, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Hong Kong, France, Brazil, and Korea.  Other nations with significant membership include Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, India, and Argentina.

In 2007, the Co-op did more than $5,000,000 in sales, achieving a net profit of $20,173.

In September 2008, the Co-op launched ''The Front Table'', a web magazine for book lovers and Co-op members. [[Barack Obama]]'s patronage of the bookstore garnered attention in the wake of his election.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 January 2009|accessdate=28 December 2014|title=Barack Obama gives Seminary Co-Op a big boost|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/02/entertainment/et-bookstore2 | first=Julia | last=Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The University of Chicago Divinity School''' is a graduate institution at the [[University of Chicago]] dedicated to the training of academics and clergy across religious boundaries. Formed under Baptist auspices, the school today lacks any sectarian affiliations.

It is ranked number one in the field of the study of religion according to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council's]] measure of faculty quality in its survey of all doctoral granting programs in religious studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chronicle.com/article/nrc-religion/124664/]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the departments of religious studies/religion at Harvard, Yale and Columbia University, it is responsible for training the majority of those appointed to tenure track positions in religious studies at American universities. The school offers courses leading to the Ph.D. in history of religions, anthropology and sociology of religion, religion and literature, history of Christianity, history of Judaism, Islamic studies, biblical studies, philosophy of religion, theology, religious ethics, and religion in America.

==History==

* History of Christianity
* Biblical Studies

The Committee on Constructive Studies in Religion

==Research and special programs==
===The Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion===
The vision of establishing an institute for the advanced study of religion at the University of Chicago came from [[Joseph M. Kitagawa]], the Dean of the Divinity School from 1970 to 1980. Martin E. Marty, a historian of modern Christianity, worked closely with Dean Kitagawa to formulate the purposes and operation of the institute within the context of the Divinity School's general mission of teaching and graduate research. The Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion officially opened in October 1979, with Professor Marty as its director. Subsequent directors have been [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] (1983–1992), a historian of medieval Christianity; [[Frank Reynolds (academic)|Frank Reynolds]] (1992–2000), a historian of religions who specializes in Buddhist studies; W. Clark Gilpin (2001–2004), a historian of American Christianity and theology; Wendy Doniger (2004–2007), a historian of religion who specializes in Hinduism and mythology; and William Schweiker, who works in the field of theological ethics. In 1998, the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion was renamed the Martin Marty Center, to honor its founding director for his singular distinction as historian, author, and commentator on religion and public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist Studies Program===

A number of faculty in the Divinity School and the humanities departments of South Asian Languages and Civilizations (SALC), East Asian Languages and Civilizations (EALC), History, and Art History participate in an interdisciplinary program in the study of the Buddhist Traditions. Degrees are offered through matriculation in one or the other of these programs. The program sponsors workshops and seminars throughout the academic year. Affiliated faculty include [[Daniel A. Arnold]], Steven Collins, Paul Copp, [[Matthew Kapstein]], James Ketelaar, Gary A. Tubb, and [[Christian K. Wedemeyer]].

==Swift Hall==
[[File:Swift Hall at the University of Chicago.jpg|thumb|Swift Hall]]
Completed in 1926, Swift Hall was designed by Coolidge and Hodgdon in the [[collegiate Gothic]] style of architecture. It contains lecture halls, seminar rooms, faculty offices, a student-run coffee shop, a commons, and administrative offices. The lecture hall was formerly the home of the Divinity Library, before its holdings were consolidated into the central research library, the Joseph Regenstein Library.

==Bond Chapel==
[[File:Bond Chapel at the University of Chicago.jpg|thumb|Bond Chapel]]
Southwest of Swift Hall and connected to it by a beautiful stone cloister is the Joseph Bond Chapel. Both Swift Hall and Bond Chapel were designed by the architects Coolidge and Hodgdon at the end of the Gothic revival period in America. The Chapel was given by Mrs. Joseph Bond in memory of her husband, a former Trustee of the Baptist Theological Union, the predecessor institution of the Divinity School. Mr. and Mrs. Bond's daughter, Elfleda, married Edgar J. Goodspeed, a member of the university faculty noted for his translation of the New Testament. After her death in 1949, Mr. Goodspeed donated the stained-glass windows in her memory.

The cornerstone of the chapel was laid by Mrs. Bond on April 30, 1925, and the chapel was opened in October, 1926. In 2012-13, the Chapel was renovated and its organ was replaced by the Reneker Organ. Inspired by instruments built in northern Germany in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Reneker Organ was built by Canadian master organ builder Karl Wilhelm in 1983 for Graham Taylor Hall at the former home of the Chicago Theological Seminary. It was dedicated in 1984 in honor of the late Robert W. Reneker and Betty C. Reneker, and was moved to Bond Chapel in the autumn of 2012. The cloister connecting Bond Chapel to Swift Hall was reconstructed in 2014. A cloister garden is due to be installed between Swift and Bond in 2015.

As a Divinity School chapel in a major university, its main function is to provide a sanctuary for reflection, worship, and community gatherings. It is used extensively for weddings, funerals, mid-week Divinity School worship services, other religious services, theater presentations, and musical events performed by the University's smaller musical groups, such as Collegium Musicum. It seats about 300 persons.

==Publications==
===History of Religions===
For half a century, ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]'' has set the standard for the study of religious phenomena from prehistory to modern times. ''History of Religions'' strives to publish scholarship that reflects engagement with particular traditions, places, and times and yet also speaks to broader methodological and/or theoretical issues in the study of religion. Toward encouraging critical conversations in the field, HR also publishes review articles and comprehensive book reviews by distinguished authors.

===The Journal of Religion===
Founded in 1882, ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' is one of the publications by which the Divinity School of The University of Chicago seeks to promote critical, hermeneutical, historical, and constructive inquiry into religion. While expecting articles to advance scholarship in their respective fields in a lucid, cogent, and fresh way, the Journal is especially interested in areas of research with a broad range of implications for scholars of religion, or cross-disciplinary relevance. The Editors welcome submissions in theology, religious ethics, and philosophy of religion, as well as articles that approach the role of religion in culture and society from a historical, sociological, psychological, linguistic, or artistic standpoint.

===Ethics===
Founded in 1890, ''Ethics'' publishes scholarly work in moral, political, and legal philosophy from a variety of intellectual perspectives, including social and political theory, law, and economics. In addition to major articles, Ethics also publishes review essays, discussion articles, and book reviews.

===Criterion===
''Criterion'' was founded in 1961 by then-dean Jerald Brauer. This journal is published twice a year to reflect the ongoing life of the Divinity School community.

===Circa===
''Circa'' was founded in 1992 as the dean's newsletter. It is published in the fall and spring quarters to update Divinity School alumni and friends on the latest community developments.

The '''University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt''' (or '''Scav Hunt''', colloquially '''Scav''') is an annual four-day team-based [[scavenger hunt]] held at the [[University of Chicago]] from Thursday to Sunday of [[Mother's Day]] weekend in May. The list of items, usually over 300 items long, encompasses cryptograms, competitions, build challenges, a 3 course meal, and a 2,000 mile road trip. &quot;Scav Hunt&quot; is well known for its quirky, strange, or impossible items.&lt;ref name=NewYorker2012 /&gt; Scav held the [[Guinness World Record]] for largest scavenger hunt from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref name=Baker2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Sierra|title=Provo breaks record for world’s largest scavenger hunt |url=http://universe.byu.edu/2014/09/16/provo-breaks-record-for-worlds-largest-scavenger-hunt1/|accessdate=17 May 2015|publisher=[[The Universe (student newspaper)|The Universe]]|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scavenger Hunt is held annually over four days in May, such that the final day's judging of items (known as 'judgment day') is held on [[Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RedEye2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-05-07/news/39147778_1_list-chicago-scavenger-hunt-residence-hall | title=U. of C.

These teams (ranging in size from 1 to over 250 each) then participate in what has been described as [[collective effervescence]], as they chant various team-based and humorous slogans, eventually coalescing into a repeated &quot;we want the list&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CollegeEvent&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://college.uchicago.edu/2014-university-chicago-scavenger-hunt-list-release | title=Event: The 2014 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List Release | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=8 May 2014 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicagoMaroonPhotos2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/11/scav-inspires-student-creativity-and-matrimony/ | title=Scav Inspires Student Creativity and Matrimony | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=11 May 2015 | accessdate=14 May 2015 |author1=McVea, Andrew  |author2=Hauck, Grace |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, at midnight, the judges (members of the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Organizing Committee) run into the center of this gathering, and announce that year's list release challenge.

Each challenge is designed to delay teams in acquiring a paper copy of that year's list of approximately 300 items. Previous examples have included the pages of the list buried under sand at a nearby beach, team captains kidnapped and forced to transcribe items onto their bodies with Sharpies, and copies of the list suspended from a wall six feet high ten feet away from a team representative, because &quot;the floor is lava.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/the-hunter-games | title=The Hunter Games | publisher=[[The New Yorker]] | date=2 July 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015 | author=Marx, Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a team has obtained the list, they travel back to their headquarters (usually a dorm lounge or apartment living room) to begin working on the list of items. Several hours after the release of the list the judges publish it online (usually around 3:00 A.M. [[Central Time Zone|CST]] on the Thursday of the Hunt), thus making it available for teams unable to attend &quot;List Release.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RickVug&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rickvug.com/node/34 | title=SlashDot Article | publisher=Rick Vugteveen | date=17 February 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;ScavHuntArchives2006List&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/2006.pdf | title=The 2006 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Organizing Committee | date=11 May 2006 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the list has begun with a set of official rules, including:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Acquisition of Items. All items on the List can be obtained and performed legally. It may involve smooth talking, or it may involve something else, but it is all possible. The Judges take no responsibility for your getting thrown into the clink—be it local clink, state clink, federal clink, or Colonel Klink. If you end up there, it is your fault.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Props. All props must, always and forever, be mad props.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A Good Time. For a good time, call (202) 762-1401.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The phone number above is for the voice announcer of the [[United States Naval Observatory]]'s &quot;[[Master clock|Master Clock]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USNO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/voice.html | title=USNO Master Clock Voice Announcer | publisher=United States Naval Observatory | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/ |title=USNO Master Clock — Naval Oceanography Portal |publisher=Usno.navy.mil |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides time measurements at the [[atomic clock|atomic level]] of precision to the [[GPS satellite]] constellation run by the [[U.S. Air Force]].

After the official rules, a list of qualifying factors for the road trip portion of the scavenger hunt is included. These qualifying factors have been included in the list at the behest of UChicago's Center for Leadership and Involvement (the governing body for [[University of Chicago#Student organizations|registered student organizations]]) since 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScavHuntArchives2006List&quot;/&gt; The road trip, itself, though, has been a part of the Hunt since 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScavHuntArchives1991List&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/1991.pdf | title=The 1991 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Organizing Committee | date=11 May 1991 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the road trip qualifications, all &quot;Scav Olympics&quot; events are listed. These are original competitions designed annually and held on Eckhart Quad Saturday afternoon of the Hunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBEZ2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wbez.org/story/who-brought-tiger-photosvideos-inside-uofc-scav-hunt-86274 | title=Who brought the tiger?

Finally, following the above sections, is the list of all general category items. Item lists are broken up into pages, with one or several judges contributing to the items on each page.

===Road trip===

Road trip, one of the more original elements of the hunt, is constrained by several factors. The furthest destination may be no more than 1,000 miles from Chicago and the trip must be completed between 8 a.m. Thursday morning and Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/05/17/dispatches-from-the-scav-road-trip/&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, road trip is completed with participants wearing ridiculous costumes. Items for the road trip are scattered throughout the main list.

Drivers on the road trip are held to the following requirements:

* Minimum age of 18.
* Must have had a valid U.S. driver’s license for at least two years.
* Must have more than 2,000 miles driving experience.
* Cannot have received any moving violations or convictions or court-ordered supervision.
* Must be alcohol- and drug-free.
* Must have valid automobile insurance.

===Friday night event===
On the Friday Night of the Scavenger Hunt, there is usually a large themed event held in one of the gathering spaces on campus. In recent years, this event has been a wedding,&lt;ref name=DNAInfo2015/&gt; a sleepover party with pillow and blanket forts,&lt;ref name=&quot;College2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://college.uchicago.edu/uniquely-chicago/story/scav-past-and-present | title=Scav: Past and Present | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=29 October 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2015 | author=Rhee, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[prom|prom dance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Previously, this event took the form of a large party held on the main quads attended by scavenger hunt participants and nonparticipants alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maroon2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2008/05/09/scav-hunt-festivities-consume-campus/ | title=Scav Hunt festivities consume campus | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=9 May 2008 | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Yang, Mimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, this party involved a theme. Each team would design their own section of the party with drinks and attire adhering to this theme.

This long string of parties ended when, in 2006, during a particularly bad storm, the party was moved inside Cobb Hall. The theme that year was &quot;visions of the future.&quot; ORCSA, the university administration body responsible for overseeing the Hunt, shut down the party due to intoxicated participants and property damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maroon2006Party&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2006/05/16/scav-hunt-party-in-cobb-shut-down-2/ | title=Scav Hunt party in Cobb shut down | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=16 May 2006 | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Brown, Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Items==
Items on the list range from completely unintelligible codes to large scale construction to performances and competitions to very blatant &quot;go-find-it&quot;s of interesting objects.

===Showcase===

=== Notable items ===

* A periodic coffee table. (25 points plus 1 point per element included)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scavhunt1.uchicago.edu/lists/2007.pdf|title=ScavOlympics|accessdate=8 February 2012|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Ready for battle (4590500259).jpg|thumb|A Scav participant wearing a suit of armor made of sponges during the 2010 hunt]]
Scav Hunt was founded in 1987 by Chris Straus, who organized the list and judged items collected by other residents of Hitchcock house, with Cassie Scharff, Diane Kelly, and [[Nolan McCarty]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CollegeSecretHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://college.uchicago.edu/uniquely-chicago/story/secret-history | title=Secret History: What do the Senior Class Gift and Scav Hunt have in common? Christopher Straus, LAB’84, AB’88, MD’92, tells all. | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=1 August 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable item that has yet been completed was from the 1999 list; a [[breeder reactor]] in a shed was successfully built in front of Ida Noyes Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scavhunt1.uchicago.edu/lists/1999/node2.html|title=Items|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The item itself was a joke referring to the &quot;Radioactive Boy Scout&quot; [[David Hahn]]. The students irradiated [[thorium]] with [[thermal neutrons]] and observed traces of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/99/990519.scavhunt.nyt.html|title=In Chicago, Ph.D.'s Take a Back Seat to a Degree of Silliness|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Scav Hunt was the subject of a documentary titled ''The Hunt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periphrastic.com/about.html|title=The Hunt|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 Scav Hunt was also the subject of a documentary, ''Scavengers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecore.uchicago.edu/springsummer08/the-searchers.shtml|title=The Searchers|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scav Hunt formerly held the [[Guinness World Record]] for largest scavenger hunt.&lt;ref name=Baker2014/&gt; To obtain the record, the Judges organized a miniature scavenger hunt during the 2011 Hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dries|first1=Katie|title=In its 25th year, University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt breaks a world record|url=http://www.wbez.org/story/its-25th-year-university-chicago-scavenger-hunt-breaks-world-record-86200|accessdate=17 May 2015|publisher=[[Chicago Public Media]]|date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller event was required to meet the Guinness World Record definition of a scavenger hunt. The Scav Hunt has since been officially surpassed for the title of the world's largest scavenger hunt by &quot;Passport to Provo,&quot; an event organized by [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] and [[Google]].&lt;ref name=Baker2014/&gt;

== Judges ==
[[File:The University of Chicago is watching you (5694539537).jpg|thumb|Enormous [[googly eyes]] attached to Harper Memorial Library during the 2011 hunt]]
The Scavenger Hunt committee is a [[University of chicago#Student organizations|registered student organization]] at the University of Chicago. The committee is made up of judges, those who make the list and determine item completion, and non-judges, who help with other administrative tasks. Judges are known as &quot;Hot Side Hot&quot; while non-judge members are known as &quot;Cold Side Cold&quot;.&lt;ref name=bylaws&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws|url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/bore.html|work=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list is compiled solely by the panel of judges, though the panel also organizes other aspects of the Scav Hunt. Judges begin compiling the list after the end of each Scav Hunt weekend, and continue to add items throughout the year. Members of the panel, of course, are sworn to secrecy of the contents of next year's list.

Any University of Chicago student with a GPA above 0.5 may apply to be a judge.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt; Potential judges submit applications consisting of a questionnaire and a sample list of 30 items. Applicants are chosen to interview with the existing judges based on merit. New judges are often previous team captains or perennial participants of the Hunt. Actual methods of judge selection, however, are kept secret. Fragments of the sample lists of the newly chosen judges are often added to next year's list. Applications for new judges open at the beginning of October. New judges are selected by the end of the calendar year. Judges are appointed for life, but are required to maintain eligibility to join a student organization to remain active.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lore.html|work=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head judge, known as the Scavenczar, is appointed at the end of the Scavenger Hunt each year. He or she oversees the planning and execution of the next Scav Hunt, until his or her successor is named.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt;

'''Yerkes Observatory''' is an [[Observatory#Astronomical_observatories|astronomical observatory]] in [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/ Yerkes Observatory-Home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/aboutus/history.php The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago-A Bit of History]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The observatory, which calls itself &quot;the birthplace of modern astrophysics,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/ Observatory website]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1897 by astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]] and financed by businessman [[Charles Tyson Yerkes|Charles T. Yerkes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/history/1892.html Yerkes Observatory - 1892-1893 History of Yerkes Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; 
It represented a shift in the thinking about observatories, from their being mere housing for telescopes and observers, to the modern concept of observation equipment integrated with laboratory space for [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. 

The observatory houses a 40&quot; [[refracting telescope]], the largest ever successfully used for astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Notable astronomers who have conducted research at Yerkes include [[Edwin Hubble]] (who did his graduate work at Yerkes and for whom the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was named), [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] (for whom the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra Space Telescope]] was named), prolific Russian-American astronomer [[Otto Struve]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/aboutus/history.php The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago-A Bit of History]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the twentieth-century popularizer of astronomy [[Carl Sagan]].

==Telescopes==
{{comparison optical telescope primary mirrors.svg}}
Yerkes Observatory's {{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[refracting telescope]] was built by the refracting telescope company [[Alvan Clark &amp; Sons]]. It is the largest refracting telescope used for scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The mounting and tube for the {{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=out|disp=flip|adj=on|sp=us}} telescope was exhibited at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago before being installed in the observatory. The grinding of the lens was completed later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/history/1893.html Yerkes Observatory - 1893 History of Yerkes Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory also houses {{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and {{convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[reflecting telescopes]]. Several smaller telescopes are used for educational purposes.

==Research==
Research conducted at Yerkes includes work on the [[interstellar medium]], [[globular cluster]] formation, [[infrared]] astronomy, and [[near-Earth objects]]. The [[University of Chicago]] also maintains an engineering center in the observatory, dedicated to making and maintaining scientific instruments. In 2012 the engineers completed work on the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera (HAWC), which will be an integral part of the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/hawc.html Yerkes Obervatory-R &amp; D-HAWC]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Researchers also use the Yerkes collection of over 170,000 archival photographic plates that date back to the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/plates/plates.html The Yerkes Obervatory Photographic Plates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and preservation plans==
In March 2005, the University of Chicago announced plans to sell the observatory and its land on the shore of [[Geneva Lake]]. Two purchasers had expressed an interest: Mirbeau, an East Coast developer that wanted to build luxury homes, and [[Aurora University]], which has a campus straddling the Williams Bay property. The Geneva Lake Conservancy, a regional conservation and [[land trust]] organization, maintained that it was critical to save the historic Yerkes Observatory structures and telescopes for education and research, as well as to conserve the rare undeveloped, wooded lakefront and deep [[forest]] sections of the {{convert|77|acre|m2|adj=on|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} site.  On June 7, 2006, the University announced it would sell the facility to Mirbeau for US$8 million with stipulations to preserve the observatory, the surrounding {{convert|30|acre|m2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, and the entire shoreline of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/060607.yerkes.shtml The agreement provided for preservation of historic Yerkes Observatory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Mirbeau plan, a 100-room resort with a large [[spa]] operation and attendant parking and support facilities was to be located on the {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} virgin wooded Yerkes land on the lakeshore—the last such undeveloped, natural site on Geneva Lake's {{convert|21|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} shoreline. About 70 homes were to be developed on the upper Yerkes property surrounding the historic observatory. These grounds had been designed more than 100 years previously by John Olmsted, the brother of famed [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], designer of [[New York City|New York]]'s Central Park. Ultimately,  Williams Bay's refusal to change the zoning from education to residential caused Mirbeau to abandon its development plans.

In view of the public controversy surrounding the development proposals, the university suspended these plans in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0701040304jan04,0,3146579.story?coll=chi-business-hed Topic Galleries - chicagotribune.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The university's department of astronomy and astrophysics then formed a study group, including representatives from the faculty and observatory and a wide range of other involved parties, to plan for the operation of a regional center for science education at the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/070228.yerkes.shtml Yerkes Study Group formed to consider observatory's future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The study group began its work in February 2007 and issued its final report November 30, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;[http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/ysg/YSG_Final_Report.pdf Final Report of the Yerkes Study Group, November 30, 2007, Yerkes Science Center: Optionsw for Management and Funding]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The report recommended creating a formal business plan to ensure the financial viability of the proposed science education center, establishing ownership of the proposed center before initiating plans for creating it, and forming a partnership between the University of Chicago and local interests to plan for the center. It also suggested that some lakefront and woods parcels could be sold for residential development.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;/&gt;

The '''University of Chicago Laboratory Schools''' (also known as '''Lab''' or '''Lab School''' and abbreviated '''UCLS'''; the upper classes are nicknamed '''U-High''') is a private, co-educational [[day school]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  It is affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. About half of the students have a parent who is on the faculty or staff of the University.

== History ==
The Laboratory Schools were founded by [[education in the United States|American educator]] [[John Dewey]] in 1896 in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]]. [[Calvin Brainerd Cady]] was director of the music department under Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Shiraishi, Fumiko. &quot;Calvin Brainerd Cady: Thought and Feeling in the Study of Music.&quot; ''Journal of Research in Music Education''; Summer 1999; 47, 2; ProQuest Research Library. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The school began as a [[educational progressivism|progressive educational institution]] that goes from [[nursery school]] through 12th grade.

==Campus==
The Laboratory Schools consists of two interrelated campuses. The Historic Campus, located at 1362 East 59th Street, fills two full city blocks. It houses grades 3–12 (about 1,200 students) in five connected buildings: Blaine Hall (built in 1903), Belfield Towers (1904), Judd Hall (1931), the high school (built in 1960), the middle school (1993), and Gordon Parks Arts Hall (2015). Two connected gymnasiums also sit on this campus, Sunny Gym (built in 1929) and Kovler Gymnasium (built in 2000) and students have access to both Scammon Garden and Jackman Field.

In September 2013, Lab opened Earl Shapiro Hall on its new Early Childhood Campus located at 5800 South Stony Island Avenue. This new building, designed by Valerio Dewalt Train and FGM Architects, is home to approximately 625 children in nursery through second grade. The building is named for Earl Shapiro, who graduated from Lab in 1956.

==Student body and academics==
[[File:UChicago Laboratory Schools.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Laboratory Schools]]
The school has over 1,700 students currently enrolled, though there are plans to increase the size.[http://facilities.uchicago.edu/construction/lab-school.shtml] It is considered one of the top preparatory schools in the United States, reflected in the Wall Street Journal's findings that the school is amongst the top five feeder institutions in the nation for elite colleges. It has been heralded as one of the more diverse independent schools with about 40% students of color and over 44 nationalities represented.

[[File:LB2.JPG|thumb|280px|left|The main entrance to the Lab Schools at Blaine Hall]]
Today the school is divided into a Nursery School (Pre-K and Kindergarten), Primary School (grades 1 and 2), Lower School (grades 3 through 5), Middle School (grades 6 through 8), and High School  (grades 9 through 12). Many children begin the school in nursery and continue through their high school graduation, and 75% of applications are for nursery school or 9th grade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 2007, the school was ranked fourth in the nation for its record of sending graduates to elite universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, &quot;How the Schools Stack Up,&quot; http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-COLLEGE0711-sort.html&lt;/ref&gt;

U-High offers more than 150 different classes, all are college preparatory in nature and there are 17 Advanced Placement or Advanced Topic classes. High school students may also take classes at the University of Chicago and about 20 do so each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/data/files/gallery/ContentGallery/HS_Profile_201314hires1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The school maintains four separate libraries&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/program/libraries&lt;/ref&gt; to support its teaching and learning and the library holdings top 110,000 volumes.

==Extracurricular activities==
High school students may choose from 40+ different clubs and activities. U-High students are extremely invested in academic extra-curriculars. The high school math team and the science teams are regular contenders for and winners of state titles. The school's newspaper (The Midway) and the yearbook (U-Highlights) regularly win regional and national awards, as does its arts magazine, ''Renaissance.'' Other popular activities include theater, ethnic clubs, Student Council, policy debate, and Model UN. The Model UN team is consistently ranked among the top in the nation, and is world-renowned for its competitive excellence.&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat, Issue #335, May 5, 2010, University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was recently ranked the #2 High School Model UN team in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;America's Best High School Model UN Teams: 1-5. Best Delegate, http://bestdelegate.com/fall-2011-high-school-model-un-rankings-top-1-5/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Debate Team has won numerous national circuit tournaments, and is unofficially considered to be in the Top 20 nationwide. Furthermore, U-High's Math and Science teams consistently win and place at Regional and State competitions, respectively.

The school's athletic teams, the Maroons, compete in the [[Independent School League (Illinois)|Independent School League]] (ISL) and are members of the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA). The middle school fields 15 teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track, and girls volleyball. The high school has more than 25 teams: baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and girls volleyball. All operate with a &quot;no cut policy,&quot; meaning any student who wishes to participate may, and nearly 65% of U-Highers participate on at least one team.

The high school's extracurricular activities occasionally make national and international news. For example, in 1990 [[James R. Thompson|then-Gov. Thompson]] declared a &quot;[[Matthew Headrick]] Day&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Students Hail The Conquering Scientist|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-03-10/news/9001200477_1_laboratory-schools-westinghouse-molecular-genetics|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Illinois Register, 14: Issue 45 - November 9, 1990, Volume 14, Page 106 {{!}} Document Viewer|url = http://www.mocavo.com/Illinois-Register-14-Issue-45-November-9-1990-Volume-14/680660/106|website = Mocavo|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States House of Representatives|US House]] made a proclamation&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; when then-student Headrick appeared on talk shows including [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/clip/5112674437_s23.do|title = Westinghouse Science Project Winners Discuss Their Project (audiovisual file)|last = Gumbel|first = Bryant|date = March 7, 1990|work = NBC News Today Show|location = Today New York Studio|access-date = 2015-10-30|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after winning the [[Intel Science Talent Search|Westinghouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = EDUCATION;   From Nitrogen Fixation To a $20,000 Scholarship|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/07/us/education-from-nitrogen-fixation-to-a-20000-scholarship.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1990-03-07|access-date = 2015-10-29|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = All Students Need State-of-the-art Science Education|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-03-23/news/9001240342_1_students-high-school-science-genetics|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the award, the Chicago Tribune wrote: &quot;this ... is a ... school where being on the math team ... can actually enhance one's social status.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teenage Science Whiz Captures A National Honor|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-03-06/news/9001190344_1_westinghouse-competition-science-award-laboratory-schools|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribune's coverage was controversial because, as noted previously, U-High's extracurricular activities, including the math team, operate on a &quot;no cut policy,&quot; and therefore participation was unlikely to confer social status. The faculty responded by posting a banner that humorously read: &quot;The Few. The Proud. The U-High Math Team. Conferring social status since 1990.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Westinghouse Competition Media Coverage|work=U-High Midway Student Newspaper|date=March 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable teachers ==

Lab teachers are recognized as leaders in their field. Here are a few of the notable recognitions and teachers who have worked at Lab:

•	Eight Lab teachers have received Chicago’s prestigious [[Golden Apple Award (education)|Golden Apple Award]]—more than from any other school in the city. (2009 Christina Hayward; 2007 David Derbes; 2004 Rosa McCullagh; 1994 Michael (Spike) Wilson; 1992 Jan Yourist; 1989 Catharine Bell; 1987 Hanna Goldschmidt; 1986 Randy Fowler.) Others have received the [[Kohl McCormick Early Childhood Teaching Award]].

•	A [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur “genius” award]] and the Erikson Institute Award for Service to Children are among the achievements of author/teacher [[Vivian Paley]], who spent most of her career at Lab. (Lessons from her acclaimed book ''You Can’t Say You Can’t Play'' shape Lab’s approach.)

•	Created and funded in honor of Zena Sutherland (a former U. of C. faculty member and still considered among the world’s most influential scholars of young people’s literature), the annual Sutherland Award for Excellence in Children’s Literature is one of the only student-selected book awards in the United States.

•	Lab teachers contributed to the [[University of Chicago School Mathematics Project]], the largest university-based mathematics curriculum project in the country. Their results included the nationally acclaimed ''[[Everyday Mathematics]]'' texts for elementary school students and ''Transition Mathematics'', a middle school pre-algebra text.

• [[Blue Balliett]], author of ''Chasing Vermeer'', ''[[The Wright Three]]'', and ''[[The Calder Game]]'', based her children’s mysteries on her experiences teaching students at Lab.

•	Lab classrooms are routinely visited by teachers and administrators from around the world who wish to experience first-hand the way Lab teachers integrate [[John Dewey|Dewey]]’s philosophy into their classroom experience.

The '''University of Chicago''' (also called '''Chicago University''' and, after it closed, '''Old University of Chicago''') was a college affiliated with the [[Baptist]] church in [[Chicago]] from 1857 to 1886.

The present-day [[University of Chicago]], which was established in 1890, is legally a separate institution but the new school eventually recognized Old University alumni as its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;The University of Chicago Magazine, Volumes 5-6&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wgTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA284&amp;lpg=RA1-PA284&amp;dq=old+university+of+chicago+alumni+recognized+Old+University+alumni+as+its+own&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EkC96mCjqT&amp;sig=aUaFvTW3qi-5EQIp8n9YZ8hAd78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rh_zUqHqN9CdkQeS14DgDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=old%20university%20of%20chicago%20alumni%20recognized%20Old%20University%20alumni%20as%20its%20own&amp;f=false | title=The University of Chicago Magazine, Volumes 5-6 | accessdate=2014-02-06 | pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lone remaining stone from the older school's building, which was destroyed by fire, is preserved on the present school's main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], where it is set into the wall of the arch between the Classics building and Wieboldt Hall.

==History==
[[Image:Rush Medical College class.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Students of the Old University of Chicago]]
[[Image:Old UChicago History1.png|thumb|210px|right|The Old University of Chicago]]
The land upon which the University of Chicago was established was originally part of a lakefront tract owned by Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Douglas had offered the {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} plot, worth $50,000 and located at Cottage Grove Avenue and Thirty-Fifth Street, to the Presbyterian Church for a seminary. When the church group failed to raise the $100,000 Douglas set as a precondition of his donation, he offered the site to a group of Baptists, who accepted. Douglas was no religious man but an avid promoter of Chicago; critics accused him of trying to boost the value of his adjoining lots.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Johannsen, ''Stephen A. Douglas'' (1973) pp 558, 872&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's 1856 charter required that most of the members of the Board of Trustees be of the Baptist faith. The school made no such restrictions on either faculty or students. Despite the title of university, in the early years, the tenor of the instruction was primarily collegiate and vocational in nature. Two hundred to five hundred students enrolled annually in preparatory, collegiate, law, and medical schools.

The new institution began almost immediately to encounter financial difficulties. Fundraising was hurt by Douglas' support for the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], which was regarded by many northern Baptists and other abolitionists as a betrayal,&lt;ref name=&quot;controversy&quot;&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/IntegratingTheLifeOfTheMind/TruthAndControversy.html &quot;Controversy&quot;, ''Integrating the Life of the Mind: African Americans at the University of Chicago 1870-1940''], Exhibit September 2008 - February 2009, University of Chicago Library, web exhibit 2009, accessed 23 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while the financial [[Panic of 1857]] drained the finances of many of the principal investors, rendering most of their initial subscriptions worthless.

The trustees proceeded with plans to build the university, including construction projects that were beyond the school's means because of the volatility of the market. With the university’s debt mounting rapidly, President [[J. C. Burroughs]] and the trustees sold a second wave of subscriptions. Key to this effort was [[James Hutchinson Woodworth]], a former Chicago mayor who was also president of the Treasury Bank of Chicago. Woodworth served as a university trustee from 1857 to 1869, as well as treasurer for some time.

Burroughs, who remained in office longer than any of his five successors, established in 1859 the University's Union College of Law, the city's first law school. In 1870, [[Ada Kepley]] and [[Richard A. Dawson]] received bachelor of law degrees, likely the first woman and first African American, respectively, to receive degrees from the institution. In 1872, the faculty voted to allow women as students.&lt;ref name=&quot;advocacy&quot;&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/IntegratingTheLifeOfTheMind/OldUofCIdiosyncraticAdvocacy.html &quot;Advocacy&quot;], ''Integrating the Life of the Mind'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, the Law School became jointly associated with [[Northwestern University]], and ultimately became today's [[Northwestern University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/news/150anniversary/ Law School: 150th anniversary], Northwestern University School of Law&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's finances deteriorated rapidly after Woodworth died in 1869. It was rocked by the huge costs of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, and the [[Panic of 1873]] decreased donations. In 1874, a fire damaged the university’s main physical plant.

Meanwhile, disagreements in the Board of Trustees flared up over fundraising, financial management, and faculty appointments, escalating into open conflict. Burroughs and his most vocal opponent, trustee [[W. W. Everts]], left the board. To keep Burroughs affiliated with the university, the trustees created the post of chancellor and appointed him responsible for the school's financial affairs. But the new president and Chancellor Burroughs were quickly at odds. Other administrators were hired and departed in rapid succession; by 1886, six presidents had served the university.

The university's fifth president, Galusha Anderson, appealed to philanthropists [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Leland Stanford]], but was unable to secure substantial donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mind&quot;/&gt; [[Union Mutual Life Insurance Company]], the university's chief creditor, brought suit in 1881 to foreclose the mortgage on the university's property. Anderson argued to keep the school open, but in January 1885 the court found for Union Mutual.&lt;ref name=&quot;mind&quot;&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/IntegratingTheLifeOfTheMind/MythOfOpenness.html &quot;Myth of Openness&quot;], ''Integrating the Life of the Mind'' (2009), accessed 23 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The university closed in autumn 1886, and the main building was razed in 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;frederick&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Rudolph | first= Frederick | title=The American College and University: A History | publisher=Knopf | year=1962 | page=351 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3se-H1Y_l7kC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=%22october+1,+1892%22+goodspeed&amp;q=%22october%201%2C%201892%22%20goodspeed | isbn= 978-0-8203-1284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the final meeting of its Board of Trustees in 1890, the group officially changed the name of the institution to the Old University of Chicago. This was to enable a new Rockefeller-financed Baptist school, then being organized, to have a completely separate legal entity and take the title of the [[University of Chicago]].

The Smart Museum and the adjacent [[Cochrane-Woods Art Center]] were designed by the architect [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]].&lt;ref name=Reopening1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-21/news/9911210273_1_salvador-dali-museum-new-museum-special-exhibition |title=Grand Reopening |last=Lauerman |first=Connie |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=November 21, 1999 |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Chicago began seriously planning to build an art museum and establish a permanent art collection in the 1960s (the [[Renaissance Society]] was founded in 1915, but does not collect art). 

The founding gift came from the Smart Family Foundation in 1967 and construction began in 1971. The museum was named after [[David A. Smart]] (1892–1952) and his brother Alfred Smart (1895–1951), the Chicago-based publishers of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'', and, with [[Tériade|Teriade]], ''[[Verve (1937–60)|Verve]]'', as well as the founders of [[Coronet Films]]. David Smart was an art collector and owned paintings by Picasso, Renoir, and Chagall. However, the founding gift was of Esquire stock and did not include any works from his personal collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Two Visionary Brothers: David and Alfred Smart|last=Mazie|first=David|publisher=Smart Museum of Art|year=2003|isbn=0935573372|location=|pages=1, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the collection was initially assembled from a variety of sources, including works of art in various university departments and gifts from foundations and individual donors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Smart Museum of Art: A Guide to Collection|last=|first=|first2=|publisher=Smart Museum of Art|year=1990|isbn=978-1555950613|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=Sue|location=|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smart's founding director was the art historian and professor Edward A. Maser and the museum was originally associated with the university's department of art history. In 1983, the museum became a separate unit of the university devoted to serving the entire community, including educational outreach activities in local public schools. In its early years it was known as the Smart Gallery but was renamed the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art in 1990 to reflect the expanded mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Noble and Symmetrical Conception of Life: The Arts at Chicago on the Edge of a New Century|last=Boyer|first=John W.|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=111–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Collection ==
There are over 15,000 objects in the Smart Museum's collection. A selection is displayed in four permanent collection galleries dedicated to modern art, Asian art, European art, and contemporary art. These galleries are rehung annually. The collection is also often used in special exhibitions and for courses taught at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smartcollection.uchicago.edu|title=Smart Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=smartmuseum.uchicago.edu|publisher=|access-date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Modern art ===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1915, Soldat jouant aux échecs (Soldier at a Game of Chess), oil on canvas, 81.3 x 61 cm, Smart Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1914-15, ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess|Soldat jouant aux échecs (Soldier at a Game of Chess)]]'', oil on canvas]]
The museum's modern art collection features paintings by [[Paul Delvaux]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Walt Kuhn]], [[Norman Lewis (artist)|Norman Lewis]], [[Roberto Matta|Matta]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Diego Rivera]], and Mark [[Mark Rothko|Rothko]] while the Joel Starrels, Jr. Memorial Collection includes sculpture by [[Jean Arp]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], and [[Auguste Rodin]]. 

One of the most notable items in the collection is the original dining room furniture designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for the [[Robie House]], which is more or less on permanent display. Most of the original Robie House furniture as well as a few window casings were transferred into the museum collection before it opened in 1974. At that time, the Robie House was still being used as offices for the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Asian art ===
The Asian collection includes literati scroll paintings from China, Japan, and Korea, Buddhist sculpture, ceramics, and ''ukiyo-e'' prints. The museum also has a large contemporary Chinese photography collection. 

=== European art ===
[[File:Cecco Bravo Angelica y Ruggiero 1660 David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Cecco Bravo, Angelica y Ruggiero, 1660]]
The European collection focuses on art created before 1900. Twenty-one works from the [[Samuel Henry Kress|Kress Collection]] were donated to the Smart when it opened, including paintings by [[Cecco Bravo]], L[[Luca Cambiasi|uca Cambiaso]], [[Donato Creti]], [[Il Pordenone|Pordenone]], [[Girolamo da Santacroce|Girolamo da Santa Croce]], [[Jan Steen]], and [[Paolo Veronese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kressfoundation.org/collection/ViewCollection.aspx?id=72&amp;repoID=18388|title=Kress Foundation Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kressfoundation.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable works include [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s [[The Disasters of War]] and paintings by [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Louis Dupré (painter)|Louis Dupré]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]]. 

=== Contemporary art ===
[[File:Sylvia Sleigh-The Turkish Bath-1973.jpg|thumb|Sylvia Sleigh, The Turkish Bath, 1973]]
The contemporary collection includes works by [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Antony Gormley]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Sylvia Sleigh]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Claire Zeisler]]. The museum has a notable collection of Chicago artists, with concentrations of works by the [[Chicago Imagists]], the Monster Roster, and self-taught artists like [[Henry Darger]] and [[Lee Godie]]. 

The collection also includes more recent works by [[Dawoud Bey]], [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], [[Theaster Gates]], [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]], [[Laura Letinsky]], [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Dan Peterman]], and [[Tony Tasset]]. 

The museum maintains an archive of artwork, sketchbooks, letters, tools, original woodblocks, and other personal material related to the life and work of [[H. C. Westermann]]. Much of it was given to the Smart by Westermann's wife, Joanna Beall Westermann, and sister, Martha Renner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smartcollection.uchicago.edu/view/objects/asimages/36735|title=H. C. Westerman Study Collection, Smart Museum of Art|last=|first=|date=|website=smartcollection.uchicago.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Architecture ==
The Smart Museum and the adjacent [[Cochrane-Woods Art Center]], which houses classrooms and offices for the University of Chicago's department of art history, were designed by the Chicago-born architect [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]]. 

The unadorned modernist buildings are linked by covered walkways and face a common outdoor sculpture garden. The buildings are clad in [[Indiana Limestone|Indiana limestone]]. They &quot;seem simple but the design is sophisticated&quot; and relate to the gothic architecture and quadrangles found elsewhere on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=University of Chicago: An Architectural Tour|last=Pridmore|first=Jay|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1568984476|location=|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lobby of the museum features a vaulted ceiling with a north facing clerestory window. A renovation in 1999 reconfigured and expanded the public gallery spaces within the building's existing footprint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reopening1&quot; /&gt; 

At the 1971 groundbreaking for the building, [[Edward H. Levi]], the president of the University of Chicago, noted that the design was meant &quot;to display rather than to distract from the works exhibited, and to enhance communication among the scholars&quot; inside. Levi also noted that the project was originally intended to be much larger. Barnes had designed never-realized plans for music, theater, and library facilities extending to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smartmuseum.uchicago.edu/blog/groundbreaking-ceremony|title=Groundbreaking Ceremony|last=Levi|first=Edward|date=October 29, 1971|website=transcript of groundbreaking speeches|publisher=|access-date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">The '''Center for Decision Research''', part of the [[Booth School of Business]], is an interdisciplinary center devoted to research and teaching on how people make decisions and judgments. This field of study draws on [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[social psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and other disciplines to understand how individuals and groups make decisions. Researchers at the Center study the processes by which intuition, reasoning, and social interaction produce beliefs, judgments, and choices. These topics have important applications in a range of contexts, including [[management]], [[marketing]], [[finance]], and [[public policy]]. The Center's activities include a weekly research workshop, the distribution of a research paper series, and the maintenance of two research laboratories for the conduct of behavioral research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.chicagobooth.edu/cdr/labs|title=Participate in Research|accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee on International Relations''' ('''CIR''') is a one-year [[master's degree]] [[Graduate school|graduate program]] in the Division of Social Sciences at the [[University of Chicago]]. It is the oldest [[international relations]] graduate program in the [[United States]].

==History==
CIR was founded in 1928 by a group of University of Chicago [[professors]], including [[Hans Morgenthau]] and [[Quincy Wright]]. While CIR is known worldwide for one of the most distinguished programs in the study of [[international security]], CIR faculty and students are also well known for academic work in [[international political economy]], international institutions, [[globalization]], [[international law]], [[human rights]], [[comparative politics]], [[human development (humanity)|development]] and [[Area studies|regional studies]].

==Admissions==
Applicants from CIR come from around the world; about 25 percent of [[college application|applications]] and accepted [[students]] are from [[International student|outside the United States]]. Every year, CIR receives over 300 applicants for roughly 40-50 spots. In the admissions process, applicants are required to provide the standard CIR application, [[Recommendation letter|letters of recommendations]], a [[Statement of purpose|personal statement]], a 10-20 page writing sample, and their [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] scores. International applicants from non-English speaking countries also have to provide [[TOEFL]] or [[IELTS]] scores as all coursework is conducted in [[American English]]. Applicants typically have a [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] of 3.5 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher and must have a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree (or similar) from an [[accredited]] [[university]]. In addition to an applicant's academic background, relevant work experience and fit with the program are also taken into account.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Applications are evaluated by an admissions committee which includes the CIR preceptors and CIR's interim director, Prof. Dan Slater.

==The program==
The combination of intellectual diversity and analytical strength provide a stimulating environment for CIR students.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The small size and intellectual rigor of the program ensure that students with differing perspectives will challenge each other and come to a more sophisticated understanding of the complicated interaction between the realities of [[international politics]] and [[international economics]]. The program provides excellent preparation for students, whether they choose to continue their graduate studies in leading [[doctoral programs]], or decide to work in [[government]] or the [[private sector]].

Each CIR graduate student is assigned a preceptor based on their own disciplinary and research interests in [[international relations]], such as [[war]], [[area studies|regional studies]], or [[international political economy|international economics]].

===Coursework===
Students take three credited courses per [[Academic term#Collegiate calendars|quarter]], which constitutes a full-load at the University of Chicago. Of the nine total courses, two are required &quot;Core&quot; classes, including a course on [[international security]] and another on [[international political economy]]. CIR students also take three mandatory non-credit classes, including two MA thesis workshops in the [[Autumn|Fall]] and Winter quarters and a class taught by the CIR preceptors called &quot;Perspectives on International Relations&quot; in the Fall quarter. With the remaining seven credited courses, students are allowed to take any graduate-level course, with the following three restrictions: (1) seven of the nine courses must be on the CIR-approved course list, (2) at least three courses must be within the [[Division of Social Sciences]], and (3) three courses must be taken in two of the four possible fields of study.

====Fields of study====
* International Relations Theory, Security and History
* International Political Economy and Development
* Regional Studies and Nationalism
* Human Rights, Environment, and International Law

===MA thesis===
CIR students must also complete a [[thesis]] under the guidance of their preceptor and a faculty adviser of their choosing. Students will be aided by the two required MA thesis workshop classes in the Fall and Winter quarters. Each thesis is expected to be between 35-45 pages in length and below 14,000 words.

===MA with specialization===
CIR students who wish to pursue a particular research topic in greater depth than is possible in one year may pursue the second-year specialization program. Specialization is best designed for students who plan to continue with graduate studies in a [[Ph.D.]] program at the University of Chicago or elsewhere. Specialization is competitive; on average 4-6 students apply, and 2-4 are accepted.

==Joint degrees==
CIR offers [[Double degree|joint degrees]] with different programs and schools at the University of Chicago.

* BA/MA - offered only to current University of Chicago [[undergraduates]] entering their senior year
* MA/MA - with the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]]
* [[MBA]]/MA - with the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]]
* [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/MA - with the [[University of Chicago Law School]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20839">{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]] and later [[criminology]], the '''Chicago School''' (sometimes described as the '''Ecological School''') was the first major body of works emerging during the 1920s and 1930s specializing in [[urban sociology]], and the research into the urban environment by combining theory and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[fieldwork]] in [[Chicago]], now applied elsewhere. While involving scholars at several Chicago area universities, the term is often used interchangeably to refer to the [[University of Chicago]]'s sociology department—one of the oldest and one of the most prestigious. Following [[World War II]], a &quot;Second Chicago School&quot; arose whose members used [[symbolic interactionism]] combined with methods of [[field research]] (today often referred to as [[ethnography]]), to create a new body of work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Alan Fine]]. ''A Second Chicago School? The Development of a Postwar American Sociology'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The major researchers in the first Chicago School included [[Nels Anderson]], [[Ernest Burgess]], [[Ruth Shonle Cavan]], [[Edward Franklin Frazier]], [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]], [[Roderick D. McKenzie]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Robert E. Park]], Walter C. Reckless, [[Edwin Sutherland]], [[W. I. Thomas]] [http://www.bolender.com/Sociological%20Theory/Thomas,%20William%20I.%20and%20Florian%20Znaniecki/thomas,_william_i_and_florian_znaniecki.htm], [[Frederic Thrasher]], [[Louis Wirth]], [[Florian Znaniecki]]. Activist, social scientist and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Jane Addams]] also forged and maintained close ties with some of the members of the Chicago School of Sociology.

==Discussion==
The Chicago School is best known for its urban sociology and for the development of the [[symbolic interactionist]] approach, notably through the work of Herbert [[Herbert Blumer|Blumer.]] It has focused on human behavior as shaped by social structures and physical environmental factors, rather than genetic and personal characteristics. [[Biologist]]s and [[anthropologist]]s had accepted the [[theory of evolution]] as demonstrating that animals adapt to their environments. As applied to humans who are considered responsible for their own destinies, members of the School believed that the natural environment, which the [[community]] inhabits, is a major factor in shaping human behavior, and that the city functions as a microcosm:

{{quotation|''&quot;In these great cities, where all the passions, all the energies of mankind are released, we are in a position to investigate the process of [[civilization]], as it were, under a microscope.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Robert E.|title=Human Migration and the Marginal Man|journal=AJS|date=May 1928|volume=33|issue=6|page=890}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The work of Frederic E. Clements (1916) was particularly influential. He proposed that a community of vegetation is a superorganism and that communities develop in a fixed pattern of successional stages from inception through to some single climax state or to a self-regulating state of equilibrium. By analogy, an individual is born, grows, matures, and dies, but the community which the individual inhabited continues to grow and exhibit properties which are greater than the sum of the properties of the parts.

Members of the School have concentrated on the city of Chicago as the object of their study, seeking evidence whether urbanization (Wirth: 1938) and increasing social mobility have been the causes of the contemporary social problems. Originally, Chicago was a clean slate, an empty physical environment. By 1860, Chicago was a small town with a population of 10,000. There was great growth after the [[Great Chicago Fire|fire of 1871]]. By 1910, the population exceeded two million. The rapidity of the increase was due to an influx of [[immigrant]]s and it produced [[homeless]]ness (Anderson: 1923), poor housing conditions, and bad working conditions based on low wages and long hours. But equally, Thomas and Znaniecki (1918) stress that the sudden freedom of immigrants released from the controls of [[Europe]] to the unrestrained competition of the new city was a dynamic for growth. See also the [[Broken windows theory|broken windows thesis]].

{{quotation|''&quot;Ecological studies consisted of making spot maps of Chicago for the place of occurrence of specific behaviors, including [[alcoholism]], [[homicide]]s, [[suicide]]s, [[psychoses]], and [[poverty]], and then computing rates based on census data. A visual comparison of the maps could identify the concentration of certain types of behavior in some areas. Correlations of rates by areas were not made until later.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavan|first1=Ruth Shonle|title=The Chicago School of Sociology, 1918-1933|journal=Urban Life|date=January 1983|volume=11|issue=4|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Thomas, the groups themselves had to reinscribe and reconstruct themselves to prosper. Burgess studied the history of development and concluded that the city had not grown at the edges. Although the presence of [[Lake Michigan]] prevented the complete encirclement, he postulated that all major cities would be formed by radial expansion from the center in [[concentric zone model|concentric rings]] which he described as zones, i.e. the business area in the center, the [[slum]] area (called the zone in transition and studied by Wirth: 1928, Zorbaugh: 1929, and Suttles: 1968) around the central area, the zone of workingmen's homes farther out, the residential area beyond this zone, and then the [[bungalow]] section and the [[commuter]]'s zone on the periphery. Under the influence of [[Albion Small]], the research at the School mined the mass of official data including census reports, housing/welfare records and [[crime]] figures, and related the data spatially to different geographical areas of the city. Shaw and McKay created maps:
*spot maps to demonstrate the location of a range of social problems with a primary focus on juvenile delinquency;
*rate maps which divided the city into block of one square mile and showed the population by age, [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], etc.;
*zone maps which demonstrated that the major problems were clustered in the city center.
Thomas also developed techniques of self-reporting life histories to provide subjective balance to the analysis. Park, Burgess, and McKenzie are
credited with institutionalizing, if not establishing, sociology as a science. They are also criticized for their overly empiricist and idealized approach to the study of society but, in the inter-war years, their attitudes and prejudices were normative. Three broad themes characterized this dynamic period of Chicago studies: 
#culture contact and conflict. This arises from Thomas and Znaniecki (1918) and studies how ethnic groups interact and compete in a process of community succession and institutional transformation (Hughes and Hughes: 1952). An important part of this work concerned African Americans; the work of E. Franklin Frazier (1932) and Drake and Cayton (1945) shaped white America's perception of black communities for decades.
#succession in community institutions as stakeholders and actors in the ebb and flow of ethnic groups. Cressey (1932) studied the dance hall and commercialized entertainment services, Kincheloe (1938) studied church succession, Janowitz (1952) studied the community press, and Hughes (1979) studied the real-estate board.
#city politics. Merriam's commitment to practical reform politics was matched by [[Harold Foote Gosnell|Gosnell]] who researched voting and other forms of participation. Gosnell (1935), Wilson (1960), Grimshaw (1992) considered African American politics, and Banfield and Wilson (1963) placed Chicago city politics in a broader context.

The School is perhaps best known for the Subculture Theories of Thrasher, Frazier, and Sutherland, and for applying the principles of [[ecology]] to develop the [[Social disorganization theory|Social Disorganization Theory]] which refers to consequences of the failure of:
*social institutions or social organizations including the [[family]], [[school]]s, [[church (building)|church]], political institutions, policing, business, etc. in identified communities and/or neighborhoods, or in society at large; and
*social relationships that traditionally encourage co-operation between people.
Thomas defined social disorganization as &quot;the inability of a neighborhood to solve its problems together&quot; which suggested a level of social pathology and personal disorganization, so the term, &quot;differential social organization&quot; was preferred by many, and may have been the source of Sutherland's (1947) [[Differential association|Differential Association Theory]]. The researchers have provided a clear analysis that the city is a place where life is superficial, where people are anonymous, where relationships are transitory and friendship and family bonds are weak. They have observed the weakening of primary social relationships and relate this to a process of social disorganization (comparison with the concept of ''[[anomie]]'' and the [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain Theories]] is instructive).
:''For a complete discussion, see [[Social disorganization theory|Social Disorganization Theory]], [[Symbolic interactionism]] and [[Subcultural theory|Subcultural Theory]].''

==Ecology and social theories==
Vasishth and Sloane (2000) argue that while it is tempting to draw analogies between organisms in nature and the human condition, the problem lies in [[reductionism]], i.e. that the science of biology is oversimplified into rules that are then applied mechanically to explain the growth and dynamics of human communities. The most fundamental difficulties are definitional. If a community is a group of individuals who inhabit the same place, is the community merely the sum of individuals and their activities, or is it something more than an aggregation of individuals? This is critical in planning research into group interactions. Will research be effective if it focuses on the individuals composing a group, or is the community itself a proper subject of research independently of the individuals who compose it?  If the former, then data on individuals will explain the community, but if the community either directly or indirectly affects the behavior of its members, then research must consider the patterns and processes of community as distinct from patterns and processes in populations of individuals. But this requires a definition and distinction between &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;process&quot;. The structures, forms, and patterns are relatively easy to observe and measure, but they are nothing more than evidence of underlying processes and functions which are the real constitutive forces in nature and society. The Chicago School wanted to develop tools by which to research and then change society by directing urban planning and social intervention agencies. It recognized that urban expansion was not haphazard but quite strongly controlled by community-level forces such as land values, zoning ordinances, landscape features, circulation corridors, and historical contingency. This was characterized as ecological because the external factors were neither chance nor intended, but rather arose from the natural forces in the environment which limit the adaptive spatial and temporal relationships between individuals. The School sought to derive patterns from a study of processes, rather than to ascribe processes to observed patterns and the patterns they saw emerge, are strongly reminiscent of Clements' ideas of community development.

==Conclusions==
The Chicago Area Project (CAP) was a practical attempt by sociologists to apply their theories in a city laboratory. Subsequent research showed that the youth athletic leagues, recreation programs, and summer camp worked best along with urban planning and alternatives to incarceration as crime control policy. Such programs are non-entrepreneurial and non-self-sustaining, and they fail when local or central government does not make a sustained financial commitment to them. Although with hindsight, the School's attempts to map crime may have produced some distortions, the work was valuable in that it moved away from a study of pattern and place toward a study of function and scale. To that extent, this was work of high quality that represented the best science available to the researchers at the time.

The Social Disorganization Theory itself was a landmark and, since it focuses on the absence or breakdown of social control mechanisms, there are obvious links with [[social control theory]]. In ''Causes of Delinquency'' (1969) [[Travis Hirschi]] argued that variations in delinquent behavior among youth could be explained by variations in the dimensions of the social bond, namely attachment to others, commitments to conventional goals, acceptance of conventional [[moral]] standards or [[belief]]s, and involvement in conventional activities. The greater the social bonds between a youth and society, the lower the odds of involvement in delinquency. When social bonds to conventional role models, values and institutions are aggregated for youth in a particular setting, they measure much the same phenomena as captured by concepts such as network ties or social integration. But the fact that these theories focus on the absence of control or the barriers to progress, means that they are ignoring the societal pressures and cultural values that drive the system [[Robert K. Merton|Merton]] identified in the Strain Theory or the motivational forces Cohen proposed were generating crime and delinquency. More modern theorists like Empey (1967) argue that the system of values, norms and beliefs can be disorganized in the sense that there are conflicts among values, norms and beliefs within a widely shared, dominant culture. While condemning crime in general, law-abiding citizens may nevertheless respect and admire the criminal who takes risks and successfully engages in exciting, dangerous activities. The depiction of a society as a collection of socially differentiated groups with distinct subcultural perspectives that lead some of these groups into conflict with the law is another form of cultural disorganization, is typically called cultural conflict.

Modern versions of the theory sometimes use different terminology to refer to the same ecological causal processes. For example, Crutchfield, Geerken and Gove (1982: 467-482) hypothesize that the social integration of communities is inhibited by population turnover and report supporting evidence in the explanation of variation in crime rates among cities. The greater the mobility of the population in a city, the higher the crime rates. These arguments are identical to those proposed by social disorganization theorists and the evidence in support of it is as indirect as the evidence cited by social disorganization theorists. But, by referring to social integration rather than disintegration, this research has not generated the same degree of criticism as social disorganization theory.

[[File:House of Tan Yeok Nee, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The House of [[Tan Hiok Nee|Tan Yeok Nee]] now enjoys a new lease on life as the Asian campus for the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]].]]
The '''House of Tan Yeok Nee''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 陈旭年宅第 or 陈旭年大厦) is a [[mansion]] building located at the corner of [[Penang Road, Singapore|Penang Road]] and [[Clemenceau Avenue]] in the [[Museum Planning Area]] in [[Singapore]]. Today, the building is being used as the [[Asia]]n [[campus]] for the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]].

==History==
The mansion belonged to [[Chaozhou]]-born [[businessman]] [[Tan Hiok Nee|Tan Yeok Nee]] who built it in 1885. It is the only survivor of the ''[[Four Mansions]]'' (四大厝) built in the late 19th century. [[Tan Hiok Nee|Tan Yeok Nee]] was born in 1827. To escape poverty in his village, he came to the region of [[Southeast Asia]] then known as ''Nanyang'' where he traded [[textiles]]. Later, he planted [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[spices]] in [[Johor]] and became a [[port]] owner. In addition, Tan joint ventured with another [[Teochew people|Teochew]] [[tycoon]], Tan Seng Bo, and Chang, a [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hoklo]] (Hokkien) leader, in the then legal [[opium]] and [[liquor]] trades. Three years later, [[Tan Hiok Nee|Tan Yeok Nee]] [[immigrate]]d to Singapore, where he built this &quot;House of Administration&quot;. He soon amassed a great fortune through his involvement with his trades and the ownership of lucrative [[property]].

Tan's house is one of two surviving examples of traditional [[China|Chinese]] mansions in Singapore; the other is River House in [[Clarke Quay]]. Tan lived in this mansion for most of his life; he died in [[China]] at age 75. He outlived his sons and the house was left to his eight grandsons.

At the turn of the 20th century, when the [[Singapore]]-[[Johor]] [[Railway]] was being built, the house was acquired for use by the Tank Road Station master. Within a [[decade]], the government granted Tan's house to the [[Anglican Church]], which established St Mary's Home and School for [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] Girls in 1912.

On 28 May 1938, the [[Salvation Army]] established their headquarters in Tan's house. The house remained the Salvation Army's centre of operations for over 50 years, with the exception of the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|war]] years, during which the [[Japan]]ese controlled it.

After the war, it was found shattered and torn to pieces by repeated [[bombing]] and [[looting]]. [[S$]]86,000 was spent on [[repair]]s and rebuilding over the next few years.

In July 1951, it was officially reopened by [[Governor]] [[Sir]] [[Franklin Gimson]]. Forty years later in 1991, the Salvation Army's headquarters was relocated to [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]] and the house was sold to the [[Cockpit Hotel]]. The House of Tan Yeok Nee has since been purchased by the [[Wing Tai Group]], which invested [[S$]]1.2 million for its [[Building restoration|restoration]]. The building is now occupied by The [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]] as its Asian campus.

The House of Tan Yeok Nee was [[gazette]]d as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 29 November 1974.

==Architecture==
The House of Tan Yeok Nee occupies approximately 2,000 square metres of elevated land along Clemenceau Avenue. The mansion has been carefully restored with great sensitivity to ensure that the original [[architecture]] and character of the house is kept intact. The [[wall]]s, [[tile]]s, [[roof]], [[column|pillar]]s, carvings and [[pottery]] were restored to their original state of a [[century]] ago through painstaking research.

However, contemporary facilities and equipment have also been incorporated to adapt the building for modern day usage. With the wide array of beautifully restored traditional Chinese decorative elements and the convenience of present-day state-of-the-art technology around the house, this combination of 'old' and 'new' provides a unique environment rich in [[history]] and [[culture]].

The front and back portions of the house face east and west. Pillars on the front door are made of marble with colourful carvings of stories reflecting the lives of Tan Yeok Nee’s [[ancestor]]s in Chaozhou. The back of the house has a distinctive style exhibited by beams with special Teochew tiles, a main pillar decorated with [[gilding|gold-plated]] carvings, and a marble floor. Exquisite, colourful tiles reflect Chinese people characters and animals.

The House of Tan Yeok Nee is typical of Teochew-style residential buildings. The structure exhibits the harmony of [[Yin and Yang]], shown at the top of the ceiling in [[gold]], [[wood]], [[water]], [[fire]], and [[earth]] – the [[Wu Xing|five elements]]. Armed with traditional philosophical ideas, the designer coordinated the entire building’s design to reflect the balance and harmony represented by the five elements. This unique design not only enriches the artistic value of the walls, but also represents the unity of [[prosperity]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[longevity]], [[health]] and [[happiness]].

Off-Off Campus stems from a rich tradition of improv comedy at the U of C.  In the early 1950s, improv as it is known today was invented on the University of Chicago campus at the Woodlawn Tap{{Dubious|date=March 2012}}.  In 1959, the group, called the [[Compass Players]], went on to form [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle96&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Off-Off Campus celebrating first decade with two shows | date=May 23, 1996 | publisher=The Chicago Chronicle| url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960523/off.shtml| accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Bernie Sahlins returned to the U of C in order to re-establish improv and sketch comedy on the south side of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle94&quot;/&gt;  The first generation of Off-Off Campus was trained by Sahlins, and the group continues to build on the foundation he created.&lt;ref name=&quot;maroon1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=

{{italic title}}
'''''Everyday Mathematics''''' is a  [[pre-K]] and [[elementary school]] [[mathematics curriculum]] developed by the [[University of Chicago School Mathematics Project]] (not to be confused with the University of Chicago School of Mathematics). The program, now published by [[McGraw-Hill Education]], has sparked debate.

== History ==

''Everyday Mathematics'' curriculum was developed by the University of Chicago School Math Project (or UCSMP )&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsmp.uchicago.edu  Chicago educational]- retrieved in 2004&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded in 1983.

Work on it started in the summer of 1985. The 1st edition was released in 1998 and the 2nd in 2002. A third edition was released in 2007 and a fourth in 2014-2015.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bell was Project Director and James McBride was Project Director&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum structure ==

Below is an outline of the components of EM as they are generally seen throughout the curriculum.
;Lessons:
A typical lesson  outlined in one of the teacher’s manuals includes three parts&lt;ref&gt;[http://everydaymath.uchicago.edu/about/sample_lessons/ Example of typical lesson online]- retrieved in April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Teaching the Lesson''—Provides main instructional activities for the lesson.
* ''Ongoing Learning and Practice''—Supports previously introduced concepts and skills; essential for maintaining skills.
* ''Differentiation Options''—Includes options for supporting the needs of all students; usually an extension of Part 1, Teaching the Lesson.

;Daily Routines:
Every day, there are certain things that each EM lesson requires the student to do routinely.  These components can be dispersed throughout the day or they can be part of the main math lesson.
* ''Math Messages''—These are problems, displayed in a manner chosen by the teacher, that students complete before the lesson and then discuss as an opener to the main lesson.
* ''Mental Math and Reflexes''—These are brief (no longer than 5 min) sessions “…designed to strengthen children's number sense and to review and advance essential basic skills…” (Program Components 2003).
* ''Math Boxes''—These are pages intended to have students routinely practice problems independently.
* ''Home Links/Study Links''—Everyday homework is sent home.  Grades K-4 they are called Home Links and 4-6 they are Study Links.  They are meant to reinforce instruction as well as connect home to the work at school.
;Supplemental Aspects
Beyond the components already listed, there are supplemental resources to the program.  The two most common are games and explorations.
* ''Games''— “…Everyday Mathematics sees games as enjoyable ways to practice number skills, especially those that help children develop fact power…” (Program Components 2003). Therefore, authors of the series have interwoven games throughout daily lessons and activities.

== Scientific support for the curriculum ==

What Works Clearinghouse ( or WWC ) &lt;ref&gt;WWC: is a database math interventions prepared by a contractor for the [[U.S. Department of Education]])&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the evidence in support of the Everyday Mathematics program.  Of the 61 pieces of evidence submitted by the publisher, 57 did not meet the WWC minimum standards for scientific evidence, four met evidence standards with reservations, and one of those four showed a statistically significant positive effect.  Based on the four studies considered, the WWC gave Everyday Math a rating of &quot;Potentially Positive Effect&quot; with the four studies showing a mean improvement in elementary math achievement (versus unspecified alternative programs) of 6 percentile rank points with a range of -7 to +14 percentile rank points, on a scale from -50 to +50.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation: An average (50th percentile rank) student taught with Everyday Math could be expected to perform on average as well on the measurements used in the various studies as a student in one of the comparison programs performing at the 56th percentile rank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report on Everyday Mathematics, updated April 2007 - retrieved 2009-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

After the first edition was released, it became part of a nationwide controversy over reform mathematics.  In October 1999, US Department of Education issued a report labeling ''Everyday Mathematics'' one of five &quot;promising&quot; new math programs.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, A.;Notices of the American Mathematical Society,2000&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived endorsement of ''Everyday Mathematics'' and a number of other textbooks by an agency of the US government caused such outrage among practicing mathematicians and scientists that a group of them drafted an open letter to then Secretary of Education [[Richard Riley]] urging him to withdraw the report.  The letter &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120721221059/http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/riley.htm  AN OPEN LETTER TO UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, RICHARD RILEY]&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the November 18, 1999 edition of the Post and was eventually signed by more than 200 prominent mathematicians and scientists including four [[Nobel Laureates]] (one of whom, [[Steven Chu]], has since become Secretary of Energy), three [[Fields Medalists]], a [[National Medal of Science]] winner from the University of Chicago, and the some chairs of  math departments.&lt;ref&gt;departments : at Caltech, Cornell, Stanford, UC Irvine, University of Maryland, University of Rochester, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate has continued at the state and local level as school districts across the country consider the adoption of ''Everyday Math''.  Two states where the controversy has attracted national attention are California and Texas.  California has one of the most rigorous textbook adoption processes and in January 2001 rejected ''Everyday Mathematics'' for failing to meet state content standards.&lt;ref&gt;California State Board of Education 2001 Mathematics Adoption Report, January 2001 [http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/im/documents/mathrpt.pdf] Retrieved April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  
Everyday Math stayed off the California textbook lists until 2007 when the publisher released a California version of the 3rd edition that is supplemented with more traditional arithmetic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/im/documents/mathadoptrep07f.pdf California State Board of Education 2007 Mathematics Primary Adoption Report, (2008)]- Url retrieved April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; reigniting debate at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;quote by Samuels,D,2009-04- 14, [http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_12138069 &quot;Palo Alto school]-URL retrieved April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
In late 2007, the Texas State Board of Education took the unusual step of rejecting the 3rd edition of ''Everyday Math'' &lt;ref&gt;State Board of Education Summary of Action Items, November 16, 2007 [http://www.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/summary/2007/nov07sum.pdf] Retrieved April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; after earlier editions had been in use in more than 70 districts across the state.  The fact that they singled out ''Everyday Math'' while approving all 162 other books and educational materials raised questions about the board's legal powers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K, (2008-01-16) [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/011708dnmettextbooks.2a88fb6.html &quot;Rejection of math textbook sparks debate on state board's authority&quot;], ''Dallas Morning News'', Retrieved April 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Texas dropped Everyday Mathematics, saying it was leaving public school graduates unprepared for college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/new-york/texas-challenges-city-on-math-curriculum/66711/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory''' was the personal [[observatory]] of [[George Ellery Hale]], constructed by his father, William E. Hale, in 1890 at the family home in the [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] section of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photoarchive.lib.uchicago.edu/db.xqy?one=apf6-00670.xml Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory Buildings, Instruments, Equipment, Grounds]&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that the [[spectroheliograph]], which Hale had invented while attending [[MIT]], was first put to practical use; and it was here that Hale established the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]''. Kenwood's principal instrument was a twelve-inch [[refracting telescope|refractor]], which was used in conjunction with a [[diffraction grating|Rowland grating]] as part of the spectroheliograph. Hale hired [[Ferdinand Ellerman]] as an assistant; years later, the two would work together again at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]].

Hale's work attracted the attention of many in the astronomical community, and when he was hired at the [[University of Chicago]] as a professor of astronomy, more advanced astronomy students initially used the Kenwood Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Early history and ''Beat'' poetry censorship controversy==
Before censorship by the university administration, ''Chicago Review'' was an early and leading promoter of the [[Beat Movement]] in American literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=J. Donald Adams |coauthors= |title=Speaking of Books |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D15F7355E127A93CAA8178ED85F4C8585F9&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=On+Writers+of+Beat+Generation&amp;st=p |quote=This spring the Chicago Review devoted a good part of its issue to the presentation of ten San Francisco poets.... The poems are prefaced by a brief statement from Jack Kerouac on &quot;The Origins of Joy in Poetry.&quot; |page=2 |work=New York Times Book Review|date=May 18, 1958|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1958, it published an excerpt from Burroughs' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', which was judged [[obscene]] by the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' and sparked public outcry;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, David (1996) [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/review/60th/14burroughsindex.shtml article on Burroughs], Autumn 1996 double-issue of the ''Chicago Review ''&lt;/ref&gt; this episode led to the censorship of the following issue, to which the editors responded by resigning and starting a new magazine in which to freely publish Beat fiction.

''Chicago Review'' became the subject of considerable controversy in 1959, when the [[University of Chicago]] prohibited editor Irving Rosenthal from publishing a winter issue that was to include [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''Sebastian Midnite'', a thirty-page excerpt from William S. Burroughs's ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' and a thirty-page work by [[Edward Dahlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Bill.  ''I Celebrate Myself:  The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg'', p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Village Voice'', March 18, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theado, Matt.  ''The Beats:  A Literary Reference''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charters, Ann.  ''The Portable Beat Reader'', 1992, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Journal'' [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0610/chicagojournal/review.shtml &quot;60-year Review&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concern of the university was that the work might be deemed obscene. All but one editor quit the paper.  Rosenthal, Ginsberg and others responded by founding ''[[Big Table (journal)|Big Table]]''; its first issue included ten chapters of ''Naked Lunch''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Ian. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth Century Poetry in English'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/UnspeakableVisions/InPrintLiterary.html ''The Beat Generation in Print: The Literary Magazines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the ongoing nationwide conflict between traditional vs. Beat fiction, the impact of the creation of ''Big Table'' was such that, as [[Thomas Pynchon]] recalled, among the literature college students at [[Cornell University]], &quot;'What happened at Chicago' became shorthand for some unimaginable subversive threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Pynchon]] (1984) ''[[Slow Learner]]'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chicago Review'' also played a significant role in introducing [[Zen]] to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Religion: Zen: Beat &amp; Square&quot;, ''Time'', July 21, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Nock-Hee Park, ''Apparitions of Asia: modernist form and Asian American poetics'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1929 to 1935, the Society was led by important photographer and artist [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], who helped create groundbreaking exhibitions of modernists including [[Braque]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]]. Important one-person exhibitions organized by the Society included [[Henri Matisse]] (1930); [[Alexander Calder]] (1934); [[Fernand Léger]] (1936); [[László Moholy-Nagy]] (1939); John Sloan (1942); Käthe Kollwitz, [[Paul Klee]] (1946), [[Mies van der Rohe]] (1947); [[Diego Rivera]] (1949); [[José Clemente Orozco]] (1951); [[Marc Chagall]] (1958); [[Réné Magritte]] (1964) and [[Henry Moore]] (1967).  A distinguished history of educational programs featured luminaries such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], Alfred Barr, [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], and [[Paul Tillich]].

From 1974 through mid-2013, curator Susanne Ghez led the Renaissance Society. During her tenure, Ghez exhibited artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[On Kawara]], [[Gunther Forg]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Thomas Struth]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Arturo Herrera]], [[Darren Almond]], [[Thomas Hirschhorn]], and [[Mark Manders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Ghez stepped down, and was replaced by Solveig Øvstebø as Executive Director and Chief Curator of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renaissance Society names Solveig Øvstebø first new executive director in nearly 40 years |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2012/11/16/renaissance-society-names-solveig-vsteb-first-new-executive-director-nearly-40-ye|work=UChicago News|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a decade prior, Øvstebø had been director of [[Bergen Kunsthall]] in her native [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinberg|first=Lauren|title=Renaissance Society names Solveig Øvstebø new executive director|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/art-design/15870636/renaissance-society-names-solveig-ovstebo-new-executive-director|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Time Out Chicago|date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamza Walker is currently Associate Curator and Director of Education. He has worked at the Society since 1994 and was called by [[The New York Times]] one of the &quot;seven most influential curators in the country&quot;, as well as &quot;one of the museum world's most talented essayists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=The Curators: Discerning and Influential|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/the-curators-discerning-and-influential.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker won the [[Ordway Prize]] in 2010, in recognition of his innovative curatorial work and his wide-ranging thinking and writing about contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ise|first=Claudine|title=HAMZA WALKER WINS $100,000 ORDWAY PRIZE|url=http://badatsports.com/2010/hamza-walker-wins-100000-ordway-prize/|work=Bad at Sports|publisher=Bad at Sports|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Darwin]]]]
The '''Darwin Centennial Celebration''' of 1959 was a worldwide celebration of the life and work of British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] that marked the 150th anniversary of his birth (February 12, 1809), the 100th anniversary of the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (November 24, 1859), and the 125th anniversary of the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']].  The major center of festivities and commemoration was the [[University of Chicago]], which hosted a five-day event (November 24 to November 28), organized by anthropologist [[Sol Tax]], that attracted over 2,500 registered participants from across the world.  According to historian V. Betty Smocovitis, the Chicago celebration &quot;outshone-and arguably may still outshine-all other scientific celebrations in the recent history of science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebration took place in the wake of the [[evolutionary synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s and the emergence, by the mid-1950s, of an organized [[scientific discipline]] of [[evolutionary biology]], and was an opportunity for biologists of many stripes to lay claim to the legacy of Darwin.  It was also a chance for American biologists, and the American [[Society for the Study of Evolution]], to out-compete parallel British events, and for the University of Chicago to assert its emerging position as an important scientific institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smocovitis, pp. 274-282&quot;&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 274-282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
Planning for the Darwin centennial began in the mid-1950s.  In 1955 the Darwin Anniversary Committee, Inc., which included a number of Darwin's descendants as honorary officers, formed to coordinate anniversary events worldwide.  Various other organizations, including the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] (SSE), the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], various biological journals and scientific societies and institutions in many countries, also began planning independent activities and commemorative publications.  After the evolutionary synthesis, whose founders sought to make genetics-based evolution by natural selection the central uniting principle of all biology, almost all of the most prominent evolutionists in the world&amp;mdash;with the notable exception of [[Julian Huxley]], the public face of evolution in England&amp;mdash;were Americans.  Early in the planning there was considerable tension between the American-based SSE and the heavily British Darwin Anniversary Committee (which included Huxley).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smocovitis, pp. 274-282&quot; /&gt;

Through the organizational and promotional efforts of Sol Tax, most of the major figures in evolutionary biology ultimately settled on the University of Chicago as the main site for celebration activities.  Tax brought together a wide array of interests to support the Chicago events and preempt any major British plans.  Although his early efforts to secure the participation of important evolutionists had limited success, plans began coalescing after Tax arranged for Julian Huxley to serve as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago for the fall 1959 semester.  He enlisted prominent British naturalists to participate, including Huxley as the honorary chairman of the Darwin Anniversary Committee, Inc. and Darwin's grandson [[Sir Charles Darwin]] as a headline speaker, and even attempted to attract [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Elizabeth II]] to the events.  Huxley had planned London-centered events that would have conflicted with others in the United States, but held his London events in 1958 instead.  Tax got the support of Chicago's mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], during a time when the city was also trying to attract other high-profile events such as a [[World Fair]] and the [[Pan-American Games]], and coordinated with other city institutions such as the [[Chicago Zoological Park]] and the [[Chicago Natural History Museum]] to generate as much support and enthusiasm from the city as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 274-293&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Origin of Species title page.jpg|thumb|left|The title page of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', first published in 1859]]

Reuniting anthropology (including the study of human culture) with evolution and the rest of biology was one of Tax's main motivations for his organizing efforts.  Into the 1950s, anthropology was notable absent from the new discipline of evolutionary biology, with few anthropology articles in the young journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' and few anthropologists in the Society for the Study of Evolution, to the dismay of the leading evolutionists.  However, since the late 1940s the University of Chicago had been pioneering evolutionary approaches to anthropology, and Tax made prominent anthropologists an integral part of the centennial celebration program.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 287-290&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago events==
The program for the Darwin Centennial Celebration centered on a series of panel discussions that featured well-known scholars from a wide range of fields, from astronomers and biochemists to geneticists and systematists to psychologists and physiologists to anthropologists.  There were five panels, arranged to go from the [[origin of life]] to the [[evolutionary history of life|evolution of life]] to man's [[human evolution|physical]], [[Mind#Developmental_history_of_the_human_mind|mental]] and then [[sociocultural evolution]].  The center panels that focused on biological evolution included a number of the &quot;architects&quot; of the evolutionary synthesis and other important figures in the young discipline of evolutionary biology.  The evolutionary biologists had attempted to make biological evolution more prominent in the program, feeling that the origin of life research of biochemists and astronomers was too speculative while social science evolutionary research was in its infancy (with much of the anthropology community still opposed to evolutionism).  As it was they tried to set the tone for the other panels, presenting the core of evolution as natural selection acting on random genetic variation; most of the prominent critics of that view of biological evolution were not invited (with the exception of [[C. H. Waddington]], who criticized the synthesis for failing to account for [[embryology]]).  Despite the eminence of the panelists and the hopes of Sol Tax, the panels mostly&amp;mdash;with the exception of the origin of life panel&amp;mdash;presented ideas already published and broke little new ground, in part because they were intended for a popular audience; according to historian V. Betty Smocovitis  &quot;the discussions and even some of the contributed papers were surprisingly flat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 295-299, quotation from p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the panels, there was an extensive book exhibit with a wide range of evolutionary literature, as well as an exhibit in the University of Chicago Library on Darwin's published works.  Two evolution-related films were screened: ''[[The Ladder of Life]]'' and ''[[Evolutionary Aspects of Social Communication in Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 299-300&lt;/ref&gt;  Tax also scheduled a dramatic performance.  The initial plan was to stage a production of the hit 1955 play about the [[Scopes Trial]], ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (to be directed by [[Studs Terkel]]); Tax's next idea was to produce an ''[[Oklahoma!]]''-style musical with the theme of progress.  Ultimately, Tax and the Darwin Anniversary Committee commissioned business administration professor Robert Ashenhurt and investment broker Robert Pollack to produce a musical reenactment of Darwin's life.  The result, ''[[Time Will Tell (musical)|Time Will Tell]]'', was performed every night of the Darwin Centennial Celebration to great success.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 305-309&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hux-Oxon-72.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julian Huxley]]'s speech caused a controversy]]

The high point of the celebration was the Convocation ceremony that took place on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], which brought elements of sacred ritual to an otherwise mostly secular celebration.  After a procession to [[Rockefeller Memorial Chapel]], [[Bach]] organ music and a prayer, Julian Huxley&amp;mdash;a proponent of [[religious humanism]]&amp;mdash;delivered a lecture entitled &quot;The Evolutionary Vision&quot;.  In it, he described religion as an &quot;organ of evolving man&quot; that was no longer necessary in traditional forms; the audience, by and large, reacted strongly and negatively to this &quot;secular sermon&quot;.  Following Huxley's lecture, awards were presented to [[Sir Charles Darwin]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]], [[Sewall Wright]], and Julian Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 302-305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage and documentation==
In order to get the most out of the Darwin Centennial Celebration beyond the actual event, the planning committee worked with ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' to produce a documentary.  The resulting 28.5 minute film was completed by 1960, when [[John T. Scopes]] was brought in to speak at its premier.

The celebration was also covered widely in newspapers and radio by a 27-member press corps.  Huxley's address on religion and evolutionary humanism generated a particularly large amount of coverage (mostly negative).  Chicago CBS affiliate [[WBBM-TV]] aired a discussion, hosted by [[Irving Kupcinet]], that featured Sir Charles Darwin, Sir Julian Huxley, [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], and Sol Tax.  The radio program ''[[All Things Considered]]'' (among others) devoted several episodes to the event's panel discussions.  The papers contributed to the event and transcripts of all the panels were published early in 1960 as ''Evolution after Darwin'', which received favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 309-313&lt;/ref&gt;

The public response to most aspects of the celebration (with the exception of Huxley's controversial speech) was very positive.  However, the event also reinvigorated American [[creationism]]: [[Henry M. Morris]], a coauthor of the influential 1961 [[young earth creationism]] book ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', would later credit the Darwin Centennial Celebration for making clear the threat posed by evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers tried but failed to enlist significant participation by [[Historiography of science|historians of science]], who (according to one organizer) seemed &quot;baffled by the task of getting ten authors to write something new in this field.&quot;  Many historians of evolution were also participating in a competing historical event at [[Johns Hopkins University]].  Ironically, the historical interest generated by the centennial may have contributed to the subsequent development of the so-called [[Darwin Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, pp. 317-319, quotation from p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the bankruptcy of the original [[Old University of Chicago|University of Chicago]] (1857-1886), supporters began raising money for a successor. The new school opened its doors in 1890, after the old school was renamed as the Old University of Chicago. Established by oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Education Society]], the new school was built from the intellectual and social remnants of the previous institution. [[William Rainey Harper]] became the first [[list of Presidents of the University of Chicago|President of the University of Chicago]] in 1891 and its first classes were held in 1892. It has been [[coeducational]] since its founding.

Major educational reforms were instituted during the tenure of the University's fifth president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II, including the creation of the University's Common Core curriculum.

Recently, the University has begun major campus expansion projects.

==Founding==
[[Image:John D. Rockefeller 1885.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[John D. Rockefeller]] founded the University of Chicago along with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Education Society]].]]
The second University of Chicago was founded in 1890 by the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Education Society]] and oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]], who later called it &quot;the best investment I ever made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief History of the University of Chicago | year=2000 | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/resources/brief-history.html| accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Chicago held its first classes on October 1, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, David Allan (1918). ''The Quarter-Centennial Celebration of the University of Chicago'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The original tract of land, comprising the current main quads, was donated by [[Marshall Field]], owner of the [[Marshall Field and Company]] department store chain. The modern university emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization of the predecessor institution of the same name, later renamed as the [[Old University of Chicago]]. The earlier institution was founded by prominent members of the Chicago and greater Illinois community including Justice [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and Chicago Mayor [[James Hutchinson Woodworth]]. Graduates of the Old Chicago University were later assimilated into the ranks of the alumni of the University of Chicago.

The University's founding was part of a wave of university foundings that followed the [[American Civil War]]. Incorporated in 1890, the University has dated its founding as July 1, 1891, when [[William Rainey Harper]] became its first president. The first classes were held on October 1, 1892, with an enrollment of 594 students and a faculty of 120, including eight former college presidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstclasses&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=History and Purpose of the University of Chicago | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://catalogs.uchicago.edu/general-history.html| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier references to University of Chicago rise from the incorporation of [[Old University of Chicago|the first University of Chicago]], which Senator Stephen A. Douglas started with an 1856 grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodspeed | first = Thomas Wakefield | title = A History of the University of Chicago | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1916 | location = Chicago | pages = 13 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westward migration, population growth, and industrialization had led to an increasing need for elite schools away from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], especially schools that would focus on issues vital to national development. Though Rockefeller was urged to build in [[New England]] or the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] region of the United States, he ultimately chose Chicago. His choice reflected his strong desire to realize [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s dream of a natural [[meritocracy]]'s rise to prominence, determined by talent rather than familial heritage. Rockefeller's early fiscal emphasis on the physics department showed his pragmatic, yet deeply intellectual, desires for the school.

The first president [[William Rainey Harper|Harper]], an accomplished scholar (Semiticist) and a member of the Baptist clergy, believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://divinity.uchicago.edu/history-and-mission#sthash.FRbXtlNP.dpuf | title= History and Mission, The University of Chicago Divinity School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per this commitment, he brought the Morgan Park Seminary of the Baptist Theological Union to Hyde Park, and the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] was founded in 1891 as the first professional school at the University of Chicago. And yet, although founded under [[Baptist]] auspices, the University of Chicago has never had a sectarian affiliation. The [[Booth School of Business|business school]] was founded thereafter in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/history.aspx|title=Chicago Booth History|publisher=University of Chicago Booth School of Business|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Chicago Law School|law school]] was founded in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/school/history |title=History of the Law School|publisher=University of Chicago Law School|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper died in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://president.uchicago.edu/history/harper.shtml|title=History of the Office:William Rainey Harper|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.uchicago.edu/history/|title=History of the Office|publisher=University of Chicago |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] was founded to support and interpret [[archeological]] work in what was then called the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/history/|title=A Brief History of the Oriental Institute|publisher=The Oriental Institute|quote=Since its establishment in 1919, The Oriental Institute has sponsored archaeological and survey expeditions in every country of the Near East.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other American universities at the time, the University of Chicago thus came to revolve around a number of graduate research institutions, following [[Education in Germany|Germanic precedent]]. The [[College of the University of Chicago]] remained quite small compared to its [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] peers until around the middle of the 20th century.

As a result, the graduate population of the university dwarfs the undergraduate population 2:1 to this day, while the university's undergraduate student body remains the third smallest amongst the top 10 national universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is 4:1, one of the lowest amongst national universities, and all faculty members are required to teach undergraduate courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Best 361 College Rankings: University of Chicago summary | publisher=The Princeton Review (registration required) | url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/generalinfo.asp?listing=1023043&amp;ltid=1&amp;intbucketid=&amp;redirect=0 | accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;petersons&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=College Closeup: University of Chicago| publisher=Peterson's | url=http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/idd.asp?sponsor=36&amp;inunId=9162#The%20University | accessdate=2006-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210336/http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/idd.asp?sponsor=36&amp;inunId=9162#The%20University |archivedate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's traditions of rigorous scholarship were established primarily by Presidents [[William Rainey Harper]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]. Chicago opened its door to women and minorities from the very beginning, a time when they seldom had access to other leading universities. It was the first major university to enroll women on an equal basis with men,&lt;ref name=&quot;women&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=1986 | publisher=Barron's |title=Barron's Profiles of American Colleges|pages=253|quote=The University of Chicago was founded in 1890 as a private, independent institution, and was the first major university to accept women as students on an equal basis with men.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first major, predominantly white university to offer a black professor a tenured position, in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;black&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Ranking America's Leading Universities on Their Success in Integrating African Americans | publisher=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education | url=http://www.jbhe.com/features/36_leading_universities.html | accessdate=2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency of Robert Hutchins==
During his presidency, Robert Maynard Hutchins met with the president of academic rival [[Northwestern University]] to discuss the future of the two institutions through the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and the looming war. Hutchins concluded that, in order to secure the future of both universities, it was in the best interest of both for the two campuses to merge as the &quot;Universities of Chicago&quot;, with Northwestern's campus serving as the site for undergraduate education and the Hyde Park campus serving as the graduate studies campus. President Hutchins' vision for what he hoped would become the preeminent university in the world eventually faltered amidst opposition from several groups, most notably Northwestern's medical faculty. Hutchins called the episode &quot;one of the lost opportunities of American education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;merger&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The deal that almost was: 'The Universities of Chicago' | publisher=Northwestern University | url=http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/04_05_01_merger.html | accessdate=2006-06-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060513140651/http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/04_05_01_merger.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1930s, the university conducted a more successful experiment on the college. To make the university a preeminent undergraduate academic institution, administrators decided to implement President Hutchins' philosophy of [[Educational perennialism|secular perennialism]]. This led to the innovation of the common core, an educational strategy in which students read original source materials rather than textbooks, and discuss them in small groups using the [[Socratic method]] rather than a lecture approach.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Robert Maynard (1954). ''Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; The common core is still an important feature of Chicago's undergraduate education. In addition to pioneering this new undergraduate curriculum, the university took steps to eliminate &quot;distractions&quot; such as varsity sports, fraternities, and religious organizations. This attracted [[free-thinkers]] such as [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to the university. The university succeeded in eliminating all varsity sports for 20 years and all but five fraternities, although three of the eliminated fraternities were re-chartered in the 1980s.

==Science at Chicago==
The University of Chicago made contributions to 20th century science. In 1909, Professor [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] performed the [[oil-drop experiment]] in the Ryerson Physical Laboratory on the university campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;oildrop&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Historical Sketch, 1893–1986 | publisher=The University of Chicago Department of Physics | url=http://physics.uchicago.edu/historical_sketch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment allowed Millikan to calculate the charge of an [[electron]] and paved the way for the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1940s. The American Physical Society now designates Ryerson Laboratory a historic physics site.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicphysics&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= American Physical Society to commemorate University of Chicago as historic physics site in honor of Nobel laureate Robert Millikan | publisher=The University of Chicago News Office | url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/061128.millikan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Manhattan Project]], University of Chicago chemists, led by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element [[plutonium]]. The [[George Herbert Jones Laboratory]] was the site where, for the first time, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured in September 1942. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. Room 405 of the building was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in May 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutonium&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Room 405, George Herbert Jones Laboratory | publisher=National Park Service | url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail2.cfm?ResourceId=735&amp;Date=1995&amp;Ownership=Private&amp;priorityname=Priority1&amp;ResourceType=Building| accessdate=2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1942, scientists achieved the [[Metallurgical Laboratory|world's first self-sustained nuclear reaction]] at a university athletic field known as [[Stagg Field]] under the direction of professor [[Enrico Fermi]]. A sculpture by [[Henry Moore]] marks the spot, now deemed a [[National Historic Landmark]], where the nuclear reaction took place. The original Stagg Field has since been demolished to make way for the [[Regenstein Library]].

Other scientific discoveries that have taken place at the University of Chicago include:
* The technique of [[radiocarbon dating]], developed in 1949 by [[Willard Libby]] and his team during his tenure as a professor at the university. Libby was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1960 for this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Arts at Chicago==
[[Image:Rockefeller Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rockefeller Chapel]], the tallest structure on campus.]]
Although the University of Chicago is better known for its academic and scientific achievements, its students and faculty have also made significant contributions to the arts. In 1955, the University of Chicago became the birthplace of [[improvisational comedy]] with the formation of the undergraduate comedy troupe, the [[Compass Players]].&lt;ref name=&quot;improv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Some students walk into a bar... |date=October 2005| publisher=The University of Chicago Magazine | url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0510/peer/students.shtml| accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, alumnus [[Paul Sills]], who many consider the father of improvisational theater, founded [[The Second City]] along with [[Bernard Sahlins]], also a graduate of the University. Since its founding, [[The Second City]] Theater has inspired other comedy troupes such as [[Saturday Night Live]], as well as serving as an incubator for artists such as [[Alan Arkin]], [[Mike Nichols]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Mike Myers]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Jack McBrayer]], and [[Steve Carell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Sills, father of Second City improv, dies at 80&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Paul Sills, father of Second City improv, dies at 80 | year=2008| work=Chicago Tribune | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paul-sills-obit-0603jun03,0,7097665.story| accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Professor [[Ralph Shapey]] founded the [[University of Chicago Contemporary Chamber Players]], one of the oldest and most successful professional new music groups in the nation. The Contemporary Chamber Players, also known as &quot;contempo&quot;, has given over eighty world premieres of established and emerging composers.&lt;ref name=&quot;contempo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=contempo | year=2008| publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://contempo.uchicago.edu/hist_mission.html| accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching on the [[Committee on Social Thought]], Professor [[Saul Bellow]] wrote several best-selling novels, including ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]'' in 1964 and ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]'' in 1975, for which he was awarded the 1976 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Slater|first = Elinor|author2=Robert Slater|title = Great Jewish Men|publisher = Jonathan David Company|year = 1996|pages = 42|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T91sokr_nJYC&amp;dq=great+jewish+men|chapter = Saul Bellow: Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature|chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=T91sokr_nJYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;vq=saul+bellow&amp;dq=%22saul+bellow%22+naturalized+citizen&amp;sig=Z1uJ1PxtO0mB-Zh_Fnzvv17WQgI

The University of Chicago also founded the [[Renaissance Society]] in 1915, which is devoted to the exhibition of contemporary art. The Society's 1934 exhibition of [[Alexander Calder]]'s &quot;[[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]&quot; and its 1936 survey of paintings and drawings by [[Fernand Léger]] were the first solo exhibitions of these artists in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Renaissance Society&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Renaissance Society | year=2008| publisher=The Renaissance Society | url=http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/General_Information.3.html| accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smart Museum]] was established in 1974 in association with the University of Chicago's Art History department. It was endowed by David A. Smart and his brother Alfred Smart. In 1983, the museum became a separate unit of the university devoted to serving the entire community, including educational outreach activities in local public schools. In 2000 it completed a $2 million renovation.

==1950s–1980s==
In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial [[urban renewal]] project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. For details of this urban renewal effort, see [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, John W. &quot;The Kind of University That We Desire to Become&quot;, Annual Report to the Faculty of the College (October 28, 2008).

[[Image:Snell Hitchcock1.JPG|left|thumb|Snell and Hitchcock Halls, the oldest residence halls still in use on campus]]
The Spring 1958 edition of the university's literary journal the ''[[Chicago Review]]'', edited by Irving Rosenthal and [[Paul Carroll (poet)|Paul Carroll]], published excerpts from [[William S. Burroughs]]’ experimental novel ''[[Naked Lunch]].'' The university was criticized for publishing fiction deemed [[obscene]] by a columnist in the ''Chicago Daily News'' and suppressed the Winter 1959 issue, which contained more material from the ''Naked Lunch'' manuscript. The university administration fired Rosenthal and Carroll, who regarded the university's attempt at suppressing ''Naked Lunch'' as censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Gerald E. &quot;Naked Censorship: The True Story of the University of Chicago and William S. Burroughs's Naked Lunch, Part I&quot;, ''Chicago Reader'' 24:52 (September 29, 1995): 17–18. Excerpt available online at: http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/review/60th/14burroughsindex.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The University experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when [[University of Chicago sit-ins|students occupied President George Beadle's office]] in a protest over the University's off-campus rental policies. In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, [[Democratic Workers Party|Marlene Dixon]], occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumniweekend.uchicago.edu/reu-72-scrap.shtml The University of Chicago – Alumni Weekend&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eileen|last=Boris|title=Voices of Women Historians: The Personal, the Political, the Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BHlbO6eJrQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;source=web&amp;ots=KUgwwHV8dP&amp;sig=rtafr4hjVRsxxbpzEPgycuyFdNA|accessdate=2008-06-11 | isbn=978-0-253-33494-7 | year=1999 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Hanna Holborn Gray]], then the provost of [[Yale University]], became President of the University of Chicago, the first woman ever to serve as the full president of a major research university.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==1990s–present==
[[Image:Max Palevsky in April 2015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Palevsky Residential Commons]], an undergraduate dormitory that opened in 2002.]]
In 1990, the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR) was created after the passage of the Chicago School Reform Act that decentralized governance of the city's public schools. Researchers at the University of Chicago joined with researchers from [[Chicago Public Schools]] and other organizations to form CCSR with the imperative to study this landmark restructuring and its long-term effects. Since then CCSR has undertaken research on many of Chicago's [[education reform|school reform]] efforts, some of which have been embraced by other cities as well. Thus, CCSR studies have also informed broader national movements in public education.

In 1999, then-President [[Hugo F. Sonnenschein|Hugo Sonnenschein]] announced plans to relax the university's famed [[core curriculum]], reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy led to President Sonnenschein's resignation in 2000.

In 2006, the University of Chicago's [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] became the center of controversy when [[U.S. federal courts]] [[Chicago's Persian heritage crisis|ruled to seize and auction its valuable collection]] of ancient [[Persia]]n artifacts, the proceeds of which would go to compensate the victims of a [[Ben Yehuda Street bombings|1997 bombing in Jerusalem]] that the United States believes was funded by [[Iran]]. The ruling threatens the university's invaluable collection of ancient [[clay tablet]]s held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s but officially owned by Iran.

[[Image:ChicagoTrees.jpg|thumb|left|The quadrangles of the University of Chicago were modeled after [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities.]]
In 2007, the University of Chicago received a $35 million donation from David and Reva Logan to be used toward the construction of the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts. The new arts center &quot;will be a venue for the artistic expression and multidisciplinary inquiry, performance and production of our faculty and students&quot;, said President Robert Zimmer in his May 3 note. The building was constructed next to [[Lorado Taft Midway Studios|Midway Studios]], which was the personal residence and studio for sculptor [[Lorado Taft]]. The University selected the firm of [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects]] to design the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;donation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Logan family's $35 million gift puts name on arts center | date=May 10, 2007| work=The University of Chicago Chronicle | url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/070510/logan.shtml| accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2007, the University of Chicago received a donation of $100 million from anonymous donor known only as &quot;Homer&quot;. The donation will be used as the cornerstone of a $400 million undergraduate student aid initiative. Beginning in the fall of 2008, students became eligible for enhanced financial aid packages called Odyssey Scholarships, which aim to eliminate student loans entirely among students whose annual family income is less than $75,000 and to eliminate half the student loan packages among students whose annual family income is between $75,000 and $90,000. The College expected nearly a quarter of the entire College population to benefit from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alumnus’ $100 million gift launches new Odyssey scholarship program | date=June 7, 2007| work=The University of Chicago Chronicle | url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/070607/anonymousgift.shtml| accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the [[Milton Friedman Institute]].  Friedman, a Nobel Laureate in economics, received his A.M. in economics from the university in 1933 and was a professor at the University of Chicago for over thirty years.  The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]]. Some faculty members and students signed petition against these plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;petition&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Milton Friedman Petition | url=http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/john.cochrane/research/Papers/friedman_letter.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, investor [[David G. Booth]] donated $300 million to the University's [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|Graduate School of Business]], which is the largest gift in the University's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aAHS0r6IylXI |title=Booth Donates $300 Million to Chicago Business School |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, the University of Chicago and particularly its surrounding neighborhood of [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] attracted international media attention because of former [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]] lecturer [[Barack Obama]]'s election as President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The university, established in 1890, is composed of [[College of the University of Chicago|the College]], various graduate programs, and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions and seven [[professional school]]s. Beyond [[liberal arts|the arts]] and [[sciences]], Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the [[Pritzker School of Medicine]], the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business|Booth School of Business]], the [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]], the [[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration|School of Social Service Administration]], the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]], the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] and the [[Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies]]. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,700 students in the College&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.uchicago.edu/at_a_glance.php?cid=12&amp;pid=1&amp;sel=atg|title=Students {{!}} University of Chicago Data {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=data.uchicago.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 15,000 students overall.

University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the [[Chicago school of economics]]; the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school of sociology]]; [[law and economics]] theory in legal analysis;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Law and Economics|publisher=University of Montreal |url=http://encyclo.findlaw.com/0200book.pdf|accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago school of literary criticism]]; the Chicago school of religion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chicago School | publisher=Britanica Academic Edition | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497151/study-of-religion/38081/The-Chicago-school?anchor=ref420416 | accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[behavioralism]] school of [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Building the Chicago School|last = Hanson| first = John Mark |url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/apsrnov06heaney_hansen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's physics department helped develop [[Chicago Pile 1|the world's first man-made, self-sustaining]] [[nuclear reaction]] ([[Chicago Pile-1]]) beneath the viewing stands of university's [[Stagg Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuclear Technology|last=Angelo|first=Joseph A.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ITfaP-xY3LsC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=uchicago%20nuclear%20reaction%20first%20-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;pg=PP1|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=1-57356-336-6|doi=10.1336/1573563366|date=November 30, 2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab)]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], as well as the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]].

Founded by the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society|American Baptist Education Society]] with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history [[John D. Rockefeller]], the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; [[William Rainey Harper]] became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Chicago|publisher=Encyclopedia of Education|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/University_of_Chicago.aspx#2|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the [[Association of American Universities]], an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions and Years of Admission|url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|website=Association of American Universities|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Chicago was created and [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodspeed | first = Thomas Wakefield | title = A History of the University of Chicago | publisher = The [[University of Chicago Press]] | year = 1916 | location = Chicago|page=137 | isbn = 0-226-30367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; secular institution in 1890 by the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Education Society]] and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller]] on land donated by [[Marshall Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History | publisher = University of Chicago | url = https://www.uchicago.edu/about/history.shtml | accessdate =May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like [[Silas B. Cobb]] who provided the funds for the campus' first building, [[Cobb Lecture Hall]], and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] (trustee, treasurer and donor of [[Hutchinson Commons]]), [[Martin A. Ryerson]] (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) [[Adolphus Clay Bartlett]] and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the [[Walker Museum]], a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/building/buildings.html | title= The University of Chicago and its Donors, 1889-1930 | publisher=University of Chicago | accessdate= November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized as an independent institution legally, it replaced the first [[Old University of Chicago|Baptist university of the same name]], which had closed in 1886 due to extended financial and leadership problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;frederick&quot;/&gt; [[William Rainey Harper]] became the modern university's first president on July 1, 1891, and the university opened for classes on October 1, 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;frederick&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Rudolph | first= Frederick | title=The American College and University: A History | publisher=Knopf | year=1962 | page=351 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3se-H1Y_l7kC&amp;pg=PA351 | isbn= 978-0-8203-1284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president [[William Rainey Harper|Harper]], an accomplished scholar (Semiticist) and a member of the Baptist clergy, believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://divinity.uchicago.edu/history-and-mission#sthash.FRbXtlNP.dpuf | title= History and Mission, The University of Chicago Divinity School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per this commitment, he brought the Morgan Park Seminary of the Baptist Theological Union to Hyde Park, and the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] was founded in 1891 as the first professional school at the University of Chicago.

The [[Booth School of Business|business school]] was founded thereafter in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/history.aspx|title=Chicago Booth History|publisher=University of Chicago Booth School of Business|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Chicago Law School|law school]] was founded in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/school/history |title=History of the Law School|publisher=University of Chicago Law School|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper died in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://president.uchicago.edu/history/harper.shtml|title=History of the Office:William Rainey Harper|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.uchicago.edu/history/|title=History of the Office|publisher=University of Chicago |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] was founded to support and interpret [[archeological]] work in what was then called the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/history/|title=A Brief History of the Oriental Institute|publisher=The Oriental Institute|quote=Since its establishment in 1919, The Oriental Institute has sponsored archaeological and survey expeditions in every country of the Near East.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: [[Des Moines College]], [[Kalamazoo College]], [[Butler University]], and [[Stetson University]]. In 1896, the university affiliated with [[Shimer College]] in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Lycan, ''Stetson University: The First 100 Years at 70-72,'' pp. 165-185 (Stetson University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920s–1980s ===
In 1929, the university's fifth president, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], took office; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics,&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.uchicago.edu/history/hutchins.shtml |title=History of the Office |publisher=The University of Chicago Office of the President |date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core,&lt;ref name=&quot;commoncore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/academics/commoncore.shtml|title=The Common Core|publisher=University of Chicago Office of College Admissions|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organized the university's graduate work into four divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and [[Northwestern University]] into a single university.&lt;ref name=&quot;merger&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The University of Chicago proposal |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/about/historic-moments/academics/the-universities-of-chicago.html|publisher=Northwestern university|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]]) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students.&lt;ref name=&quot;hospitalhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/about/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Medical Center |publisher=The University of Chicago Medical Center |accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Committee on Social Thought]], an institution distinctive of the university, was created.

[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|left|thumb|Some of the University of Chicago team that worked on the production of the world's first human-caused self-sustaining nuclear reaction, including [[Enrico Fermi]] in the front row and [[Leó Szilárd]] in the second.|alt=A group of people in suits standing in three rows on the steps in front of a stone building.]]
Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] helped the school to survive through the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; During World War II, the university made important contributions to the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;manhattan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=155|title=University of Chicago Met Lab|publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was the site of the first isolation of [[plutonium]] and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by [[Enrico Fermi]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;manhattan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0044&amp;numPages=51&amp;fp=N|title=The First Reactor|quote=On December 2, 1942, in a racquets court underneath the West Stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi created man's first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.|accessdate=July 15, 2009|date=December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial [[Hyde Park, Chicago#Urban renewal|urban renewal project for Hyde Park]], which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, John W. &quot;The Kind of University That We Desire to Become&quot;, Annual Report to the Faculty of the College (October 28, 2008). Excerpt available online at: https://www.uchicago.edu/pdfs/boyer_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.

The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when [[University of Chicago sit-ins|students occupied President George Beadle's office]] in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report. The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in &quot;social and political action,&quot; declared that &quot;To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/kalvenreport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/02/21/born-amidst-60s-student-protests-kalven-report-remains-controversial/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, [[Marlene Dixon]], occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumniweekend.uchicago.edu/reu-72-scrap.shtml |title=The University of Chicago – Alumni Weekend |publisher=Alumniweekend.uchicago.edu |accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eileen|last=Boris|title=Voices of Women Historians: The Personal, the Political, the Professional|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2BHlbO6eJrQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33|accessdate=June 11, 2008|publisher=Indiana university Press|isbn=978-0-253-33494-7|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Hanna Holborn Gray]], then the provost and acting president of [[Yale University]], became President of the University of Chicago, a position she held for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/president/history/gray.shtml |title=Hanna Holborn Gray (1978–1993) |publisher=University of Chicago News Office|date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, then-President [[Hugo F. Sonnenschein|Hugo Sonnenschein]] announced plans to relax the university's famed [[core curriculum]], reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education.

=== Arts ===
[[File:University of Chicago USA3.jpg|thumb|upright|Saieh Hall for Economics, housing the Department of Economics and the [[Becker Friedman Institute]]]]
The UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the [[Court Theatre (Chicago)|Court Theatre]], the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]], the [[Smart Museum of Art]], the [[Renaissance Society]], University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.uchicago.edu/content/background-and-history |title=Background and History of UChicago Arts |publisher=Arts.uchicago.edu |date=2012-08-05 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; UChicago is often considered the birthplace of [[improvisational comedy]] as the [[Compass Players]] student comedy troupe evolved into [[The Second City]] improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.

'''Housing at the [[University of Chicago]]''' includes 12 residence halls that are divided into 38 houses. Each house has an average of 70 students. Freshmen must live on-campus, and housing is guaranteed but not required thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegehousing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/houses_houses/ |title=Halls &amp; Houses |publisher=The University of Chicago |accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University operates 28 apartment buildings near campus for graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reo.uchicago.edu/graduate_housing/index.shtml |title=About Graduate Housing |accessdate=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 54% of undergraduates lived in college-owned housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Of Chicago Student Life|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-chicago-1774/student-life|website=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gates-Blake and Goodspeed Halls opened in 1892 as the first residence halls for the University of Chicago. The buildings were designed by Henry Ives Cobb and served as dormitories for divinity school and graduate students.&lt;ref name=Timline&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Timeline|url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/about_us/timeline_test/|website=University of Chicago Housing|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings feature oriels along their facades and gables along the roof line that are signs of the Chicago Gothic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pridmore|first1=Jay|last2=Kair|first2=Peter|title=University of Chicago: The Campus Guide|date=2006|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=1568984472|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first women's dorm, Foster Hall, opened in 1893. It was converted to offices in 1961-62.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timline&quot; /&gt;

===Burton–Judson Courts===
[[File:Burton-Judson Courts.jpg|thumb|left|Burton-Judson Courts]]
{{Main|Burton–Judson Courts}}
Burton–Judson Courts (BJ) is located at 1005 E. 60th St. and accommodates 313 students. Burton–Judson is one of the few undergraduate residences located south of the [[Midway Plaisance]], it is a castle-like edifice built in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] style similar to that of the University's main quadrangles.&lt;ref name=prid&gt;{{cite book |title=The University of Chicago: an architectural tour |author1=Jay Pridmore |author2=Peter Kiar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGyjEvWS6gC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=Burton+Judson+Courts#v=onepage&amp;q=Burton%20Judson%20Courts&amp;f=false |page=106 |accessdate=2010-03-23 |isbn=9781568984476 |date=2006-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Zantzinger, Borie, and Medary.&lt;ref name=prid/&gt; Burton-Judson was the first on-campus residence of eminent astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who lived in room 141 (See &quot;Carl Sagan, A Life&quot;). Burton-Judson contains six houses: Dodd-Mead, Salisbury, Linn-Mathews, Coulter, Chamberlin, and Vincent.

===Campus North Residential Commons===
Campus North, which occupies the previous location of Pierce Tower, was built from 2013 to 2016. With 15 floors, it has room to accommodate about 800 students and includes a dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/houses_houses/campus_north_residence_hall_and_dining_commons/ | title=Campus North Residential Commons | accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall contains eight renamed houses of the recently closed Breckinridge, Broadview, Maclean, New Grad, and Blackstone halls. The building is one of [[Studio Gang Architects]] many recent contracts in and around the University.

===International House===
[[File:International House of Chicago.jpg|thumb|International House]]
The International House contains undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. International House is colloquially known by students as &quot;I-House.&quot; Facing the [[Midway Plaisance]], it was created in 1932 as a gift from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] specifically to foster relationships between students from different countries. It is notable for having housed many famous artists, scientists, and scholars connected with the university, including [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. Some 40,000 people have lived there since it first opened its doors. I-House Chicago is a member of International Houses Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Houses Worldwide |url=http://ihouse.uchicago.edu/about/ |year=2007 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt in early 2000 by the University of Chicago administration to close the International House and convert it into a dormitory for the Business School resulted in large student protests and a class-action lawsuit against the university by International House residents. After months of negative media attention and intense public criticism by faculty, alumni, and local activists, the administration finally reversed its decision and allowed the International House to remain open. The International House subsequently embarked on a $30 million renovation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reversal of I-House fortunes: Building, programs to stay |url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0006/campus-news/journal-ihouse.htm |publisher=The University of Chicago Magazine |date=June 2000 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until autumn 2013, undergraduates lived in two houses located in the East Tower of International House, Booth and Phoenix. In autumn 2013, Thompson House and Shorey House moved to the West Tower of International House, due to Pierce Tower's closing.

In early 2016, the University announced that it would reserve International House's rooms entirely for undergraduate residents, and that it would no longer house international exchange students or graduate students for an indeterminate amount of time. This change is due to the University's sale of Breckinridge Hall, whose residents will be moved to International House in the fall of 2016.

===Max Palevsky Residential Commons===
[[File:Max Palevsky in April 2015.jpg|thumb|Max Palevsky Residential Commons]]
The Max Palevsky Residential Commons is located at 1101 E. 56th St. and accommodates 712 people. The buildings were designed by [[Ricardo Legorreta]], and opened in 2001. Dining is provided in the Bartlett Commons.&lt;ref name=&quot;housing.uchicago.edu&quot;&gt;[http://housing.uchicago.edu/undergraduate_housing/max_p_commons.shtml Max Palevsky Residential Commons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Three buildings constitute the Commons, sharing a common basement, while students are assigned to one of eight houses (in-dorm communities) spread amongst the buildings: Alper, Hoover, and May Houses in Max Palevsky East; Flint, Graham, and Woodward Houses in Max Palevsky Central; and Rickert and Wallace Houses in Max Palevsky West.  All houses are co-ed, although Hoover maintains single-sex floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;housing.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt;

The buildings' name recognizes alumnus [[Max Palevsky]], who had donated $20 million to the university &quot;to enhance the quality of residential life on campus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pledge of $20 million from Max Palevsky to enhance residential life |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/000713/palevsky.shtml |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blair Kamin]], a [[Chicago Tribune]] architectural critic, wrote after their 2002 opening that the buildings &quot;...just [don't] come off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicago 101 - Architecture |url=http://www1.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/chicago101/architecture/ |publisher=[[The Chicago Reader]] |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent architectural criticism has been more favorable, finding that the buildings' layout meets the needs of the modern student body and that their colors and windows echo those of their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmLLXh5TZZ4C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=max+palevsky++residence#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20palevsky%20%20residence&amp;f=false |title=The University of Chicago: an architectural tour |author1=Jay Pridmore |author2=Peter Kiar |publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]] |year=2006 |page=169 |isbn=9781568984476}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons===
[[File:Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons.jpg|thumb|Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons]]
The Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons is located in [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]], south of the [[Midway Plaisance]] at 6031 S. Ellis Ave. and accommodates 811 residents. Named South Campus Residence Hall when opened in 2009, the dorm was rededicated as the Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons in February 2015 after a $44 million donation to the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Major UChicago residence hall named for College alumna Renee Granville-Grossman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2015/01/29/major-uchicago-residence-hall-named-college-alumna-renee-granville-grossman |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is split into two sections, East and West, defined by a courtyard for each. The dorm contains eight college [[house system|houses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons |url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/houses_houses/ggrce/ |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RGGRC West contains houses Keller, Halperin, Kenwood, and DelGiorno, while RGGRC East contains Jannotta, Cathey, Crown, and Wendt. Dining is provided in the Arley D. Cathey Dining Commons.

===Snell–Hitchcock Hall===
{{Main|Snell–Hitchcock}}
[[File:Snell Hitchcock1.JPG|thumb|left|Snell–Hitchcock Hall]]
Snell-Hitchcock Hall is located at 1009 E. 57th St., on the main campus quad, and houses 156 residents in two houses. Formally Amos Jerome Snell Hall and Charles Hitchcock Hall, more commonly known as Snell–Hitchcock or Hitchcock–Snell, was built in 1892 (Snell) and 1901 (Hitchcock). They are the oldest residence halls still in use as such on campus. Snell is built in a collegiate-Gothic style, while Hitchcock is Prairie Style inspired Gothic. The buildings both feature limestone exteriors and fireplaces, hardwood molding and trim. 

Snell–Hitchcock is known for having a high level of community spirit and involvement, which is best seen at the annual [[University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt]]. Also known as Scav Hunt, it marks the high point of the year for many of the inhabitants of the two dorms; as of 2012, the Snell–Hitchcock team has won 13 of the 26 hunts to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/results.html |title=Scav Hunt Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorm is on the northwest corner of the University's Main Quadrangles at the corner of 57th St. and Ellis Avenue. It is connected via emergency exits to Searle Chemistry Laboratory.

Hitchcock was built in 1901, and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It is built in a [[collegiate Gothic]] style, like Snell and most of the [[University of Chicago]]'s campus, but has many [[prairie|Prairie School]] elements, such as stone corn husks instead of gargoyles and flat-roofed instead of gabled dormers.

Hitchcock is built in the European &quot;landing&quot; style of dormitory with five stairwells linked through the front cloister and basement, though only the basement is used now to ensure that the building is more secure. The three interior &quot;sections&quot; (Sections II-IV) are each built around a single staircase. Each interior Section consists of two floors of four double-rooms with a fourth floor that has two suites (doubles with a large living room and separate bedroom). Most of the rooms have non-working fireplaces. The first floor houses the apartment for the Resident Masters, a live-in faculty couple. Traditionally, each section has had a women-only and a men-only floor, with the suite floor being either single or mixed-sex depending on the desires of the residents.

===Stony Island Hall===
[[File:Stony Island Hall at UChicago.jpg|thumb|Stony Island Hall]]
Stony Island Hall, known simply as &quot;Stony&quot;, is located at 5700 Stony Island Ave. and houses 77 residents, with four residents to an apartment. It was built in 1988 and has four stories. Prior to the 2010-2011 school year it was only available to upperclass students, but presumably due to the record size of the 2010-2011 incoming class, Stony Island accepted First-Year students from the classes of 2014 and 2015. There is only one college house in Stony Island Hall, Stony Island House.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stony Island Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Stony Island Hall |url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/undergraduate_housing/stony_island_hall.shtml |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Being relatively isolated from the rest of campus, residents of Stony are known to be very close with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Former halls==

===Blackstone Hall===
[[File:Blackstone Hall at UChicago.jpg|thumb|Blackstone Hall]]
Blackstone Hall, located at 5748 S. Blackstone Avenue, accommodates 79 residents. There is only one college house in Blackstone Hall, called Blackstone House. The main campus quadrangles are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The six-story building contains several lounges, a computer lab, a solarium, a fireplace, and a piano. Students reside in &quot;half-double apartments&quot;, in which each pair of single rooms contains a shared kitchenette and bathroom. The average room is sized 12 by 12.5 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackstone Hall|url=https://housing.sites.uchicago.edu/blackstone-hall|publisher=Office of Undergraduate Student Housing, University of Chicago|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackstone Hall was designed by architect Ralph D. Huszagh, and construction was completed in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackstone Hall|url=http://photoarchive.lib.uchicago.edu/db.xqy?one=apf2-00819.xml|work=Photographic Archive|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1953, the University had purchased the building for use as a nurses' residence. The residents who had lived there for several years were reluctant to leave, but for the University a more pressing matter left them with no alternative. A shortage of nurses had led to a &quot;most critical situation&quot; in the University's expanding medical system, and the University could not acquire the badly needed nurses without additional housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-kimpton-blackstone&quot;&gt;University of Chicago. Office of the President. Kimpton Administration. Records, Box 51, Folders 1 and 5, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University issued termination notices to all Blackstone residents in March 1954. Remodeling of the entire interior of the building began shortly after the tenants had left.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-kimpton-blackstone&quot;/&gt; The rooms were initially constructed as hotel rooms, so the University formed apartments by connecting pairs of rooms with shared baths and kitchens. Despite the apparent urgency in Blackstone's transformation into nursing accommodations, by the end of 1954 the University continued to have difficulties with filling vacancies in the building. Blackstone was abandoned as a nurses' residence, since very few nurses had lived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-beadle-blackstone&quot;&gt;University of Chicago. Office of the President. Beadle Administration. Records, Box 370, Folder 2, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts by the housing office to fill the rooms with students, there were still vacancies for 25 student couples or 50 single women.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-kimpton-blackstone&quot;/&gt;

The Housing Bureau made the rooms available for immediate occupancy at $70–75 per month ($591–634 per month in 2012 dollars), including all utilities except phone service. Laundry machines were provided in the building's utility room. The rooms were advertised first to married students without children, and no pets were allowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-kimpton-blackstone&quot;/&gt;

In 1962, the building was transformed into a dormitory only for single undergraduate women. In 1966, University officials proposed renovations to reverse the &quot;shabbiness&quot; and deterioration seen in older buildings such as Blackstone. Repairs were needed for broken panes of glass, leaking windows, and cracked paint and plaster. Fundamental renovations were also needed for the electrical and heating systems. Damage caused by the electrical repairs and plastering required complete redecorating of almost the entire building.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrc-beadle-blackstone&quot;/&gt;

===Breckinridge Hall===
[[File:Breckoutside.JPG|thumb|right|The front of Breckinridge house]]
Breckinridge Hall is at 1442 East 59th Street. It accommodates approximately 95 residents&lt;ref name=breck&gt;{{cite web|title=Breckenridge Hall|url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/houses_houses/breckinridge_hall/|publisher=[[The College of the University of Chicago]]|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus two RAs and an RH family. There is only one college house in Breckinridge Hall, called Breckinridge House. As one of the smaller dormitories on campus, but one of the largest houses, it is home to [[undergraduate]]s, though it served [[graduate student]]s in the past. Approximately two-thirds of the rooms are single residence rooms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1898, Ina Law Robertson, an Oregon schoolteacher studying at the University of Chicago, founded &quot;Eleanor Club&quot;&lt;ref name=ef&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millineryartsalliance.com/eleanorwomensfoundation.html |title=The Eleanor's Women Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011204022907/http://millineryartsalliance.com/eleanorwomensfoundation.html|archivedate=2001-12-04 |accessdate=2013-12-09}} {{cite web |url=http://sites.google.com/site/heidispinelli/eleanor |title=Eleanor's Club |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer affordable housing for employed, single women.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://breck.comli.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=53 Retrieved 2010-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eleanor Club was very similar to YWCAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago's Eleanor Clubs: Housing Working Women in the Early Twentieth Century |author=Jeanne Catherine Lawrence |year=2000 |publisher=Vernacular Architecture Forum |jstor=3514415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Between Two Worlds: Business Women in a Chicago Boarding House 1900-1930 |author=Lisa M.

===Broadview Hall===
[[File:Broadview Hall at UChicago.jpg|thumb|Broadview Hall]]
Broadview Hall is at 5540 S. Hyde Park Blvd. and accommodates 200 residents. Originally built as a hotel, as a dormitory it is organized into three &quot;houses&quot;: Wick (the 2nd and 3rd floors), Talbot (the 4th and 5th floors), and Palmer (the 6th and 7th floors).&lt;ref&gt;[http://psac.uchicago.edu/VirtualDormTour/broadview/index.html University of Chicago Virtual Dorm Tour: Broadview (Basic Stats)]&lt;/ref&gt; Most rooms are single with private baths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psac.uchicago.edu/VirtualDormTour/broadview/typicalroom.html University of Chicago Virtual Dorm Tour: Broadview (Typical Room)]&lt;/ref&gt; Broadview is about a 20-minute walk from the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psac.uchicago.edu/VirtualDormTour/broadview/location.html University of Chicago Virtual Dorm Tour: Broadview (Location)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maclean Hall===
[[File:Maclean Hall at UChicago.jpg|thumb|Maclean Hall]]
Pronounced &quot;muh-klayn,&quot; Maclean Hall is located at 5445 S. Ingleside Ave. and accommodates 98 residents (94 in singles, 4 in two doubles), in one house called Maclean House. Although it is part of the university campus, it is located in a different ZIP code (60615) from the rest of campus and is not featured on most campus maps despite being only one block North of the [[Gerald Ratner Athletics Center]]. The four-story building, originally built as a parish retirement home, was acquired by the university and renovated in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maclean House&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Maclean House |url=http://housing.uchicago.edu/college_houses/maclean.shtml |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean Hall features the most common space of any house in the Housing System, including a full commercial kitchen that residents may use, a large central lounge and dining room, a solarium, a basement game room and an assembly room with a 15' projector wall. It is named for [[Norman Maclean]], a University of Chicago professor and author of the novel ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]''.

===New Graduate Residence Hall===
[[File:New Graduate Residence Hall at UChicago.jpg|thumb|New Graduate Residence Hall]]
New Graduate Residence Hall, commonly called New Grad, is located at 1307 East 60th Street. It currently accommodates 200 undergraduates in three houses, Midway House, Henderson House, and Tufts House. Both Henderson and Tufts Houses originally occupied Pierce Hall, but with its closure and demolition in 2013, they migrated to New Grad.

===Pierce Tower===

The '''University of Chicago Medical Center''', also known under the umbrella of '''University of Chicago Medicine''', is an American academic medical center in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]], established in 1899. Affiliated with and operated by the [[University of Chicago]], it serves as the [[teaching hospital]] for students of the institution's [[Pritzker School of Medicine]].

==History==
Once known as the '''University of Chicago Hospitals''', it was reorganized as the University of Chicago Medical Center in 2006, which it is still legally named. However, it operates under the umbrella of University of Chicago Medicine.&lt;ref name=UChicMedBrandFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2012/20120123-branding-faq.html|title=2012 Press Releases: Frequently Asked Questions: University of Chicago Medicine Brand|first=|last=|date=|publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trauma center controversy===
In 1988, the University of Chicago Medical Center decided not to renew its application to be part of the city of Chicago's adult trauma network. At the time, the decision was made to concentrate resources in the clinical specialties where the medical center could play the greatest role. Calls for a new adult level 1 trauma center surfaced after the death of Damian Turner, an 18-year-old who was killed by gunshot in August 2010. Representatives of the academic medical center have said that an adult level 1 trauma center is not something it can undertake alone and requires coordination by the city, state and other health care providers in the area. In addition, hospital representatives have said that building an adult trauma center would compromise the other distinct and critically important services for the community, such as The South Side's only level 1 trauma center for children, the South Side's only burn unit, its emergency departments for adults and children and the neonatal intensive care unit. Protesters have suggested that the [[University of Chicago]] should not be seeking financial support to attract the [[presidential library]] of [[Barack Obama]] without first committing to reopening an adult trauma facility.&lt;ref name=suntimes-renewed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/20401501-418/renewed-call-for-a-level-1-trauma-center-at-university-of-chicago-hospital.html#.U4Qm8pRdXhg | last=Thomas |first=Monifa |title= Renewed call for a Level 1 trauma center at University of Chicago hospital |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=May 28, 2013 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on a new emergency room connected to the Center for Care and Discovery is planned to be completed by mid-2018.

=== Announced Expansion ===
In December 2015, the University announced that it will be expanding the University of Chicago Medical Center. Included in the expansion will be a new adult level 1 trauma center, a 188-bed expansion which will increase the hospital to its biggest size since the 1970s, and an overhauled cancer treatment facility. The expansion is a response to increased demand for bed space as the medical center has been operating near capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2016/20160510-trauma.html|title=UChicago Medicine's bold expansion plan moves forward - The University of Chicago Medicine|website=www.uchospitals.edu|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-u-of-c-hospital-expansion-0511-biz-20160510-story.html|title=State approves U. of C. hospital expansion, adding South Side trauma center|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trauma center is expected to be completed in 2018, with the remainder of the expansion being finished by 2022.

'''The Oriental Institute''' ('''OI'''), established in 1919, is the [[University of Chicago]]'s interdisciplinary research center for ancient [[Near East]]ern (&quot;[[Orient]]&quot;) studies, and [[archaeology]] [[museum]]. It was founded for the university by professor [[James Henry Breasted]] with funds donated by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]]  It conducts research on ancient civilizations throughout the Near East, including at its facility, Chicago House, in [[Luxor, Egypt]].  The Institute publicly exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts related to ancient civilizations at its on campus building in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] community.

==History ==
James Henry Breasted built up the collection of the university's Haskell Oriental Museum. He dreamed of establishing a research institute, “a laboratory for the study of the rise and development of civilization”, that would trace Western civilization to its roots in the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;C. Breasted, ''Pioneer to the Past'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; As [[World War I]] wound down, he sensed an opportunity to use his influence in the new political climate. He wrote to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and proposed the foundation of what would become the Oriental Institute. Fundamental to the implementation of his plan was a research trip through the Middle East, which Breasted had optimistically, or perhaps naively, suggested was ready to receive scholars. Breasted received a reply from Rockefeller pledging $50,000 over five years for the Oriental Institute. Rockefeller also assured University of Chicago President Harry Pratt Judson that he would pledge another $50,000 to the cause. The University of Chicago contributed additional support, and in May 1919 the Oriental Institute was founded.&lt;ref name=UoC1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oriental Institute|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is housed in an unusual [[Art-Deco]]/[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building at the corner of 58th Street and University Avenue, which was designed by the architectural firm [[Mayers Murray &amp; Phillip]]. Construction was completed in 1930, and the building was dedicated in 1931.

In the 1990s, [[Tony Wilkinson]], founded the 'Center for Ancient Middle Eastern Landscapes' based at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Gil|title=Tony Wilkinson Remembrance|url=http://www.asor.org/news/2015/01/wilkinson.html|website=News|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role is to investigate the Middle East through [[landscape archaeology]] and the analysis of [[Geographic information system|spatial data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CAMEL|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel/about-camel|website=The Oriental Institute|publisher=The University of Chicago|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and collection==
[[Image:Bull head oriental institute chicago.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Head of a bull that once guarded the entrance to the Hundred-Column Hall in [[Persepolis]]]]
The Museum of the Oriental Institute has artifacts from digs in [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]]. Notable works in the collection include the famous [[Megiddo Ivories]]; various treasures from [[Persepolis]], the old [[Iran|Persian]] capital; a collection of [[Luristan bronze|Luristan Bronzes]]; a colossal 40-ton human-headed winged bull (or ''[[Lamassu]]'') from [[Khorsabad]], the capital of [[Sargon II]]; and a monumental statue of King [[Tutankhamun]].  The museum has free admission, although visitors are encouraged to donate US $10.00 for adults and $5.00 for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/visit/ |title=Oriental Institute |publisher=Oi.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oriental Institute is a center of active research on the ancient Near East. The building's upper floors contain classrooms and faculty offices, and its gift shop, the Suq, also sells textbooks for the University's classes on Near Eastern studies. In addition to carrying out many digs in the [[Fertile Crescent]], OI scholars have made contributions to the understanding of the origins of human civilization. The term &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; was coined by J.&amp;nbsp;H. Breasted, the OI founder, who popularized the connection of the rise of civilization in the Near East with the development of European culture.

In 2011, among other projects OI scholars completed publication of the 21-volume ''[[Chicago Assyrian Dictionary]]'', a basic cultural reference work. The effort was begun in 1921 by J.&amp;nbsp;H. Breasted, and continued by Edward Chiera and [[Ignace Gelb]], with the first volume published in 1956.  Dr. [[Erica Reiner]] as editor-in-charge led the research teams for 44 years. She was succeeded by Dr. Martha T. Roth, dean of humanities at the university. Similar dictionaries are under way, including the ''[[Chicago Hittite Dictionary]]'' and one for [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

===Chicago House===
The Institute oversees the work of Chicago House in [[Luxor, Egypt]].  The Egyptian facility, established in 1924, performs the Epigraphic Survey, which documents and researches the historical sites in Luxor. It also manages conservation at various sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/epi/#Introduction |title=Oriental Institute &amp;#124; The Epigraphic Survey |publisher=Oi.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Main|University of Chicago Persian antiquities crisis}}
[[Image:Lammasu.jpg|left|thumb|A [[lamassu]] from the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Dur-Sharrukin]]]]

A collection comparable to the Institute's treasures could not be assembled today, since Middle Eastern governments no longer allow foreign archeologists to take home half of what they find. This had been the typical arrangement in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when most of the holdings were excavated, until the 1930s, when new antiquities laws were instituted.

In 2006, the Oriental Institute became the center of controversy when a U.S. federal court ruling sought to seize and auction its valuable collection of ancient Persian artifacts. The proceeds were to compensate the victims of a [[Ben Yehuda Street Bombing#1997 bombing|1997 bombing in Ben Yehuda Street]], Jerusalem, an attack which the United States claimed was funded by Iran. The ruling threatened the university's invaluable collection of ancient clay tablets; held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s, it is officially owned by Iran.

The tablets give a view of daily life, itemizing such elements as the daily rations of barley given to workers in nearby regions of the empire. The tablets were sent to the capital to provide a record of what they were paying workers.&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt; [[Gil Stein (archaeologist)|Gil Stein]], director of the Oriental Institute, said that details largely concern food for people on diplomatic or military missions.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; Each tablet is about half the size of a deck of [[playing card]]s and has characters of a dialect of [[Elamite]], an [[extinct language]] understood by perhaps a dozen scholars in the world.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;
[[File:Oriental Institute.jpg|thumb|University of Chicago Oriental Institute]]
Stein described the tablets as providing &quot;the first chance to hear the Persians speaking of their own empire&quot;.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; Charles Jones, Research Associate and Librarian at the Oriental Institute and tablet expert, compared them to &quot;credit card receipts&quot;.&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease /&gt; Most current knowledge about the ancient Persian empire comes from the accounts of others, most famously the Greek storyteller [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; Stein added, &quot;It's valuable because it's a group of tablets, thousands of them from the same archive. It's like the same filing cabinet. They're very, very valuable scientifically.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; The Oriental Institute had been returning them to Iran in small batches.&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsnews/&gt; The Institute had already returned several hundred tablets and fragments to Iran and were preparing another shipment when the court intervened.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; An appeals court later overturned the order.

'''Hyde Park''' is a [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|neighborhood]] and [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]], Illinois, U.S.A. It is located on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) south of the [[Chicago Loop]].

Hyde Park's official boundaries are 51st Street/Hyde Park Boulevard on the north, the [[Midway Plaisance]] (between 59th and 60th streets) on the south, [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east.&lt;ref name=ExploreChimap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorechicago.org/etc/medialib/explore_chicago/tourism/pdfs_guides_and_maps/navtech_loop_map.Par.33966.File.dat/HydePark.pdf|title=Guides and Maps - Neighborhood Maps: Hyde Park and Bronzeville|first=|last=|date=|publisher=[[City of Chicago]]|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another definition, a section to the north between 47th Street&lt;ref name=E47HydePark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydeparkchamberchicago.org/businessDirectory.php|title=Business Directory (C): Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage-Hyde Park|first=|last=|date=|publisher=Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 51st Street/Hyde Park Boulevard is also included as part of Hyde Park, although this area is officially the southern part of the [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] community area. The area encompassing Hyde Park and the southern part of Kenwood is sometimes referred to as Hyde Park-Kenwood.&lt;ref name=UrbanRenewalHPKCC/&gt;

Hyde Park hosts the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]], and two of Chicago's four historic sites listed in the original 1966 [[National Register of Historic Places]] ([[Chicago Pile-1]] and [[Robie House]]).&lt;ref name=NRIS&gt;{{NRISref|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 21st century, Hyde Park received national attention for its association with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].

== History ==

===Founding and early years===

In 1853, [[Paul Cornell (lawyer)|Paul Cornell]], a real estate speculator and cousin of [[Cornell University]] founder [[Ezra Cornell]], purchased {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of land&lt;ref name=HPHistoricalSoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydeparkhistory.org/cornell.html|title=Paul Cornell - Founder of Hyde Park|first=|last=|date=|publisher=Hyde Park Historical Society|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 51st and 55th streets along the shore of [[Lake Michigan]],&lt;ref name=ChiHistoricalSoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/622.html|title=Hyde Park|first=Max|last= Grinnell |date=|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea of attracting other Chicago businessmen and their families to the area.&lt;ref name=HPHistoricalSoc/&gt; The land was located seven miles south of Downtown Chicago in a rural area that enjoyed weather tempered by the lake – cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. It was conveniently located near the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], which had been constructed two years earlier. Cornell successfully negotiated land in exchange for a railroad station at 53rd Street. Hyde Park quickly became a popular suburban retreat for affluent Chicagoans who wanted to escape the noise and congestion of the rapidly growing city.

In 1857, the [[Hyde Park House]], an upscale hotel, was built on the shore of Lake Michigan near the 53rd Street railroad station.&lt;ref name=HPHistoricalSoc/&gt; For two decades, the Hyde Park House served as a focal point of Hyde Park social life. During this period, it was visited or lived in by many prominent guests, including [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], who lived there with her children for two and a half months in the summer of 1865 (shortly after her husband was assassinated).&lt;ref name=MTLincoln/&gt; The Hyde Park House burned down in an 1879 fire. The [[Sisson Hotel]] was built on the site in 1918 and was eventually converted into a condominium building (the [[Hampton House (Chicago, Illinois)|Hampton House]]).

In 1861, Hyde Park was incorporated as an independent township (called [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]]). Its boundaries were Pershing Road (39th Street) on the north, 138th Street on the south, [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] on the west, and [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Indiana]] state line on the east.&lt;ref name=EOCAaAttCoC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3716.html|accessdate=2007-07-18|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Keating, Ann Durkin|title=Annexations and Additions to the City of Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of the township encompassed most of what is now the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]]. Hyde Park Township remained independent of Chicago until it was annexed to the city in 1889.&lt;ref name=EOCHPT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/621.html|accessdate=2007-07-19|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Keating, Ann Durkin|title=Hyde Park Township}}&lt;/ref&gt; After annexation, the definition of Hyde Park as a Chicago neighborhood was restricted to the historic core of the former township, centered on Cornell's initial development between 51st and 55th streets near the lakefront.

===Growth and notability===

[[File:Court of Honor and Grand Basin.jpg|thumb|right|280px|In 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Hyde Park.]]

In 1891 (two years after Hyde Park was annexed to the city of Chicago),&lt;ref name=HPHistoricalSoc/&gt; the [[University of Chicago]] was established in Hyde Park through the philanthropy of [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the leadership of [[William Rainey Harper]].&lt;ref name=ChiHistoricalSoc/&gt; The University of Chicago eventually grew into one of the world's most prestigious universities, and is now associated with eighty-nine [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]].&lt;ref name=UofCNobelLaureates&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/about/accolades/nobel/|title=Nobel Laureates|first=|last=|date=|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, Hyde Park hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (a [[world's fair]] marking the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the [[New World]]). The World's Columbian Exposition brought fame to the neighborhood, which gave rise to an inflow of new residents and spurred new development that gradually started transforming Hyde Park into a more urban area. However, since most of the structures built for the fair were temporary, it left few direct traces in the neighborhood. The only major structure from the fair that is still standing today is [[Charles B. Atwood|Charles Atwood]]'s Palace of Fine Arts, which has since been converted into the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].

In the early decades of the twentieth century, many upscale hotels were built in Hyde Park (mostly along the lakefront). Hyde Park became a popular resort area in Chicago.&lt;ref name=ChiHistoricalSoc/&gt; Most of these hotels closed during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and were eventually converted into apartment and condominium buildings (most of which are still standing today).

Historical images of Hyde Park can be found in [http://explore.chicagocollections.org/records/?f2-types=Digital+Images&amp;f1-neighborhoods=Hyde%20Park Explore Chicago Collections], a digital repository made available by [[Chicago Collections]] archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Elizabeth|title=A Single Portal to Chicago’s History|url=http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2015/10/21/a-single-portal-to-chicago-history/|website=The University of Chicago News|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial integration, economic decline, and urban renewal===

Until the middle of the twentieth century, Hyde Park remained an almost exclusively [[White American|white]] neighborhood (despite its proximity to Chicago's [[History of African Americans in Chicago|Black Belt]]). Hyde Parkers relied on [[Covenant (law)#Exclusionary covenants|racially restrictive covenants]] to keep [[African American]]s out of the neighborhood. At the time, the use of such covenants was supported by the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=WashPost2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/15/AR2008101503728.html?sid=ST2008101503923|title=Uncommon Ground|first=Peter|last=Slevin|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] banned racially restrictive covenants in 1948, African Americans began moving into Hyde Park, and the neighborhood gradually became multiracial. In 1955, civil rights activist [[Leon Despres]] was elected alderman of Hyde Park and held the position for twenty years.&lt;ref name=LDespresObitTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-07/news/0905061008_1_mayor-daley-chicago-alderman-leon-despres|title=Leon Despres, 1908-2009: Chicago alderman challenged elder Mayor Daley: Liberal voice of city, 101, also championed civil rights and political reforms|first=Ron|last=Grossman|date=May 7, 2009|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despres argued passionately for [[racial integration]] and [[fair housing]] on the floor of the [[Chicago City Council]], and became known as the &quot;liberal conscience of Chicago&quot; for often casting the sole dissenting vote against the policies of Chicago's then-mayor [[Richard J. Daley]].&lt;ref name=LDespresNYT2005&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/national/31despres.html?pagewanted=all|title=Age 97, and Still at War With the Old Daley Machine|first=Jodi|last=Wilgoren|date=May 31, 2005|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, Hyde Park experienced economic decline as a result of the [[white flight]] that followed the rapid inflow of African Americans into the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=ChiHistoricalSoc/&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, the University of Chicago, in its effort to counteract these trends, sponsored one of the largest [[urban renewal]] plans in the nation.&lt;ref name=HPH1957-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddd-hph.dlconsulting.com/cgi-bin/newshph?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HPH19570116.2.5&amp;srpos=11&amp;e=-------20--1----sagan+renewal-all|title=Hyde Park Featured on TV Show|date=January 16, 1957|first=|last=|publisher=''[[Hyde Park Herald]]''| accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPH1957-2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddd-hph.dlconsulting.com/cgi-bin/newshph?a=d&amp;d=HPH19570130.2.9&amp;e=-------20--1----sagan+renewal-all|title=Hyde Parkers Tell Renewal Story|date=January 30, 1957|first=|last=|publisher=''Hyde Park Herald''|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan involved the demolition and redevelopment of entire blocks of decayed buildings with the goal of creating an &quot;interracial community of high standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=UrbanRenewalHPKCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydepark.org/historicpres/HPKCCstoryurbren.htm|title=The Hyde Park-Kenwood Urban Renewal Story|first=|last=|date=|publisher=Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the plan was carried out, Hyde Park's average income soared by seventy percent, but its African American population fell by forty percent, since the substandard housing primarily occupied by low-income African Americans had been purchased, torn down, and replaced, with the residents not being able to afford to remain in the newly rehabilitated areas. The ultimate result of the renewal plan was that Hyde Park did not experience the economic depression that occurred in the surrounding areas and became a racially integrated middle-class neighborhood.

==Subdivisions==
[[Image:Reynoldsclub.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The southwestern part of Hyde Park serves as the campus of the [[University of Chicago]], one of the world's most prestigious universities.]]

===University of Chicago campus===
The part of Hyde Park bounded by 55th Street on the north, the [[Midway Plaisance]] on the south, [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] on the west, and the [[Metra Electric District|Metra]] line on the east is the official territory of the [[University of Chicago]] campus. Most of the university's major facilities are located within the western half of this area (west of University Avenue). The part of the campus east of University Avenue is mostly residential, with many of its residents being University of Chicago faculty.

===East Hyde Park===
The part of Hyde Park located east of the [[Metra Electric District|Metra]] line is called East Hyde Park. This area has a large number of high-rise condominiums, many of them facing the lakefront. In this respect, East Hyde Park differs markedly from the rest of Hyde Park, where the vast majority of the residential structures are three-story apartment buildings and single-family homes, with only a small number of high-rise condominiums.

===Kenwood===
The area bounded by 47th Street on the north, 51st Street/Hyde Park Boulevard on the south, Cottage Grove Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east is officially the southern part of the [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] community area, but it is often unofficially considered to be part of Hyde Park due to the shared culture and history of the two areas. The name Hyde Park-Kenwood is sometimes applied to the area encompassing Hyde Park and the southern part of Kenwood. The southern part of Kenwood is notable for its many luxurious mansions, which were built at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries for wealthy Chicagoans. A number of prominent Chicagoans currently reside in this area. In particular, a mansion on the corner of Greenwood Avenue and 51st Street/Hyde Park Boulevard (on the southern edge of Kenwood) has been the home of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] since 2005. A mansion on the corner of Woodlawn Avenue and 49th Street was built for [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] and is currently owned by his successor [[Louis Farrakhan]]. In addition, there is a mansion in the 4900 block of Woodlawn Avenue that was once the home of boxing legend [[Muhammad Ali]].

==Demographics==

===Diversity===
[[Image:President Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|170px|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has lived in Hyde Park for more than twenty years.]]

Hyde Park is one of Chicago's most racially diverse neighborhoods. Its population is 46.7% White, 30.4% African American, 12.4% Asian American, 6.3% Hispanic, and 4.1% of other races or of more than one race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paral&quot;/&gt; There are significant differences between the racial demographics of the part of Hyde Park south of 55th Street (most of which is part of the University of Chicago campus) and the part of Hyde Park north of 55th Street. Residents south of 55th Street are predominantly White and Asian American, with only a relatively small percentage being African American. North of 55th Street, on the other hand, African Americans make up approximately half of the population. The population of the northwestern corner of Hyde Park (north of 55th Street and west of Drexel Avenue) is almost 100% African American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rankin|first=Bill|title=Chicago Boundaries - radicalcartography|url=http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?chicagodots|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde Park's location in the center of the predominantly African American [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]] as well as its large population of well-to-do African American residents have made it an important cultural and political hub of Chicago's African American community. Many of Chicago's prominent African American politicians, including former Chicago Mayor [[Harold Washington]],&lt;ref name=HWashington&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydepark.org/parks/birds/monkparakeets.htm|title=Monk Parakeets in Hyde Park and beyond|first=|last=|date=|publisher=Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; former U.S. Senator [[Carol Moseley Braun]],&lt;ref name=CBraun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Radar/Deal-Estate/November-2010/Carol-Moseley-Braun-Puts-Her-Hyde-Park-Home-Up-for-Sale/|title=Carol Moseley Braun Puts Her Hyde Park Home Up for Sale|first=Dennis|last=Rodkin|date=November 24, 2010|publisher=''[[Chicago (magazine)]]''|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost2008&quot;/&gt; currently live or have in the past lived in Hyde Park.

===Politics===
Hyde Parkers of all racial backgrounds are known for being staunchly [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] in their political views. About 95% of the residents vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates in general elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost2008&quot;/&gt;

==Landmarks==

==Parks==

===Promontory Point===
[[Image:Birdtrail.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A trail in [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]].]]
[[Promontory Point (Chicago)|Promontory Point]] is a man-made peninsula that extends out into Lake Michigan at 55th Street, providing spectacular views of the Downtown Chicago skyline to the north. Promontory Point is a popular location for picnicking, sunbathing, and swimming. It recently made news as the location of the wedding reception between George Lucas and Mellody Hobson in June 2013.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geiger|first1=Kim|last2=Delgado|first2=Jennifer|title=Promontory Point to serve as stage for star-studded wedding reception|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-27/news/ct-met-george-lucas-wedding-party-20130628_1_wedding-reception-promontory-point-chicago-park-district|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Park===
The southeastern corner of Hyde Park contains the northern end of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. Jackson Park consists of lagoons surrounding an island in the middle (called the Wooded Island), on which a small [[Japanese garden]] is located. It is home to a large population of beavers and over two dozen species of birds. The [[Midway Plaisance]], a wide boulevard that runs from Stony Island Avenue to Cottage Grove Avenue between 59th and 60th streets, connects Jackson Park to [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] (located to the west of Hyde Park).

==Shopping districts==
[[File:La Petite Folie.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The courtyard of the Hyde Park Shopping Center.]]

53rd, 55th, and 57th streets host most of the businesses in Hyde Park.

===53rd Street===
53rd Street is Hyde Park's oldest shopping district, lined with many small businesses and restaurants offering various dining options. [[Harper Court]], a small-business-oriented shopping center, extends north of 53rd Street along Harper Avenue. A [[farmers' market]] is held there in the summer.

===55th Street===
The segment of 55th Street between the [[Metra Electric District|Metra]] line and the lake offers a series of ethnic restaurants serving Thai, Japanese, and Korean cuisine. To the west of the Metra line between 54th and 55th streets lies the Hyde Park Shopping Center. The shopping center is anchored by the Treasure Island grocery store, and also includes a [[Walgreens]], [[Ace Hardware]], [[Office Depot]], [[Potbelly Sandwich Works]], the Bonjour Bakery and Cafe, and an upscale French restaurant called &quot;La Petite Folie.&quot;

===57th Street===
57th Street is noted for its [[independent bookstore]]s, including the South Side branch of Powell's and the general-readership branch of the [[Seminary Co-op]] bookstore, known as &quot;57th Street Books.&quot; 57th Street also offers the Medici Restaurant and Bakery, Z&amp;H Cafe, and the Salonica Restaurant, along with small grocery stores, hair stylists, and dry cleaners. On the first weekend in June, the venerable [[57th Street Art Fair]] takes up 57th Street between Kimbark and Kenwood avenues.

'''Woodlawn''', on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], is one of Chicago's 77 [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]]. It is bounded by [[Lake Michigan]] to the east, 60th Street to the north, Martin Luther King Drive to the west, and 67th Street to the south. Both [[Hyde Park Career Academy]] and the all-boys Catholic [[Mount Carmel High School (Chicago)|Mount Carmel High School]] are in this neighborhood; much of its eastern portion is occupied by [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Woodlawn section of the park includes the site of the planned [[Barack Obama Presidential Center|Obama Presidential Library]].  The northern edge of Woodlawn contains a portion of the campus of the [[University of Chicago]].

==Demographics==
In the 1990 census, Woodlawn had approximately 27,000 individuals, living in 10,000 households. Over 98% of the population was [[African American]], over half were on some form of public aid, and the median household income was over $13,000. As of 2008, according to city-data.com, the median household income is over $25,000 and in parts of eastern Woodlawn the white population is almost 30% and growing fueled by gentrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com|title=City-Data.com - Stats about all US cities - real estate, relocation info, crime, house prices, cost of living, races, home value estimator, recent sales, income, photos, schools, maps, weather, neighborhoods, and more|work=city-data.com|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial transition===

Up until 1948, Woodlawn was a middle class, white neighborhood, which grew out of the floods of workers and commerce from the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Columbian Exposition]]. During the first half of the century, many [[University of Chicago]] professors lived in Woodlawn. With the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling outlawing racially [[restrictive covenant]]s in the 1950s, the combination of the expanding African American urban population, their limited housing options, and exploitive real estate maneuvers that divided up apartments into [[kitchenette]]s, Woodlawn began to have its first African American residents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Cayton and Drake described the anxieties and clashes that took place at the edge of the ghetto in ''Black Metropolis''. The play ''[[Raisin in the Sun]]'' is based on [[Lorraine Hansberry]] and her family, who were one of the first to move in.

Like other communities bordering the ghetto, Woodlawn experienced intense bouts of [[white flight]] when the first African Americans moved into the neighborhood (especially the [[Washington Park Subdivision]]). Many institutions and people moved to the suburbs, a process that was facilitated by new federal housing loans. This combination of white flight from large apartments and high housing demand of the incoming African American population often proved lucrative for realtors, who routinely subdivided the vacated apartments. From this, buildings were over-filled with families. Absentee landlords seldom did much to maintain the buildings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Others attempted to integrate this area but met with limited success. For example, the [[First Presbyterian Church (Woodlawn, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] (6400 South Kimbark) integrated in 1954 and, by the 1960s, had a markedly mixed character. However, older members often felt put out by the demographic and &quot;cultural&quot; changes that came with integration, and by the mid-1960s, the Church's finances and membership rates were in trouble. For better or for worse, there had been an across the board change in the community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===1960s===
By the early 1960s Woodlawn was a predominantly African American neighborhood with a population of over 80,000 people. 63rd Street was one of the busiest streets on the South Side and was famous for its jazz clubs. Despite its bustle, Woodlawn was an economically deteriorating community, and attempts to revive its citizenry were short-lived and fractured. The community escaped the riots that devastated the West Side after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. Nevertheless, most business owners fled. A rash of arsons destroyed a reported 362 abandoned buildings between 1968 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1378.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The University of Chicago===

In [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] to the north, similar demographic and racial changes began in the 1950s but with radically different results. The University of Chicago, a large land owner with vested interest in the character of the neighborhood, fought through many avenues against what it saw as the encroachment of blight.

As Arnold Hirsch argues in his chapter &quot;Neighborhood on a hill&quot; in ''Making the Second Ghetto'', the University, through the SECC and, at times, with brute force, made Hyde Park the site of one of the first &quot;urban renewal&quot; projects in the country. In an attempt to maintain a number of white families, the University tore down &quot;slum&quot; areas, often employing eminent domain powers. In the process, many African Americans were displaced from Hyde Park, and cultural centers like 55th Street were leveled.

After their success in Hyde Park, the University moved quickly to begin a second urban renewal project in Woodlawn. A one mile wide area from 60th to 61st in Woodlawn was scheduled for renewal and the University's planned South Campus. The plans were drawn, there was a press conference, and the campus was eventually constructed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

At one time, the University of Chicago Law School raised more than $10,000 each year for charitable support for the children of Woodlawn but in 1999 it eliminated that support and shifted the funding to student scholarships for public interest jobs primarily outside the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;See Spring 1999 issues of The Phoenix, the University of Chicago Law School's student newspaper, on file in the Lauinger Library at 1111 S. 60th St., Chicago, IL 60637, but not available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TWO (The Woodlawn Organization)==
The Woodlawn Organization coalesced around the perception that the University would pursue a land use policy in Woodlawn as it did in Hyde Park, and it has its roots in the pastors' Alliance of Woodlawn. Several years earlier, the Alliance had called in [[Saul Alinsky]], founder of the [[Industrial Areas Foundation]], to discuss plans to organize the community. But several major members of the Alliance at that time were displeased with Alinsky's brashness and controversial direct tactics. In the initial years, when TWO was still under the IAF umbrella, [[Nicholas Von Hoffman]], Alinsky's second in command, planned most of the actions. After the University's plans were known, several prominent churches gave the seed money for the organization, which began in 1961.

TWO, like other IAF organizations, was a coalition of existing community entities such as churches, business and civic associations. These member groups paid dues, and the organization was run by an elected board. The TWO moved quickly to establish itself as the &quot;voice&quot; of Woodlawn, mobilizing existing leadership and bringing up new leadership. A prime example of the newly empowered leadership in TWO was Reverend [[Arthur M. Brazier]], who was the first spokesperson and eventual president. Brazier started out as a mail carrier, became a preacher in a store front church, and then, through TWO, burgeoned into a national spokesman for the black power movement. Brazier  became a very powerful pastor in Chicago.

As Fish argues in ''Black Power/White Control'' TWO picked issues that mobilized resident participation, and at the same time built power for the organization to take on large outside entities like the University and the City (i.e. Mayor Daley). The group took part in the flurry of activity surrounding the Freedom Rides and the Civil Rights Movement by loading up over 40 buses of people from Woodlawn and riding to City Hall to register to vote. They also rallied against slum landlords and cheating business owners. TWO also took action on the University and were able to gain a seat on the City planning board (which stopped the University's plans{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}).

TWO faced continually worsening conditions in the neighborhood, and there are many arguments about its efficacy. Especially controversial was Brazier's opposition to a planned and nearly completed [[Green Line (CTA)|Green Line]] extension to [[Dorchester (CTA station)|Dorchester]], which forced the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] to tear down the nearly completed station and the tracks east of the [[Cottage Grove (CTA station)|Cottage Grove terminal]] and forfeit millions of dollars in federal funds in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Woodlawn East Community And Neighbors Inc.==

As TWO moved to consolidate its position as the Voice of Woodlawn, other community organizations arose to deal with specific issues of housing and community empowerment, such as the arson fires that destroyed hundreds of buildings in Woodlawn in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps the most prominent of these organizations is Woodlawn East Community And Neighbors Inc. (WECAN)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wecanwoodlawn.org&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Mattie C. Butler, a 40-year Woodlawn resident and sister of Hall of Fame R&amp;B singer/current Cook County Commissioner Jerry Butler.

Butler founded WECAN in October 1980 after watching 13 children die in an arson fire in a building next door to her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0602/features/south.shtml|title=The University of Chicago Magazine|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WECAN quickly became a neighborhood and citywide advocate for rescuing at-risk and abandoned buildings, preserving an estimated 5000 units of housing in Woodlawn since its founding. Many of its programs - Abandoned Property Program, Vintage Homes For Chicago, Step-Up Housing - have become citywide models. WECAN was a founding member of the citywide Chicago Rehab Network of community developers. The organization and its founder, Mattie C. Butler, have been honored with local and national awards including the 1989 Petra Foundation Award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petrafoundation.org/fellows/Mattie_Butler/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2008 Community Empowerment Advocate of the Year Award.

As the focus of development in Woodlawn has shifted toward new construction and condo conversion, WECAN is seen as a vocal advocate for affordable housing for low-moderate income residents and especially seniors. That stance has on occasion brought the organization into conflict with other groups in Woodlawn, particularly TWO, who have pushed for new development at what WECAN sees as the expense of current residents. WECAN led the opposition to the teardown of the 63rd Street CTA elevated line, a battle it lost. Woodlawn has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the city and is particularly affected by foreclosures of apartment buildings and condominium conversions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

WECAN sits on the New Communities Program Executive Steering Committee, operates 132 units of affordable housing, and operates supportive services, after school programs and its Housing Resource Center.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Gangs==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Jeff Fort]] and Eugene Hairston ran a small gang of neighborhood kids centered near 66th and Blackstone called the [[Black P. Stones|Blackstone Rangers]]. By the middle of the 60s, Fort and Hairston had pulled together twenty-one other local street gangs, thus becoming the dominant gang on Chicago's South Side, engaging in numerous criminal activities while maintaining a political activist facade.&lt;ref&gt;Will Cooley, “‘Stones Run It’: Taking Back Control of Organized Crime in Black Chicago, 1940-1975,” Journal of Urban History 37:6 (November, 2011), 911-932.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1966, in the midst of a violent drive to consolidate power and intimidate rivals, the Rangers provided security as Dr. Martin Luther King and the Congress On Racial Equality marched through hostile white neighborhoods like Cicero and Marquette Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://areachicago.org/p/issues/6808/blackstone-rangers/&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the influence of both the Black Nationalist movement and the nonviolent civil rights movement, they changed their name to &quot;The Black Peace Stone Nation&quot;. During the riots in the aftermath of Dr. King's assassination, the &quot;Stones&quot; were credited with preserving and protecting the Woodlawn neighborhood (albeit through extortion and intimidation),&lt;ref&gt;http://areachicago.org/p/issues/6808/chicago-april-1968-oral-history-project/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/photos/Kingfuneral.html|title=The Death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.|work=uic.edu|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw minimal disturbance in contrast with neighborhoods like Garfield Park and the West Side.

Over time, the ties with the nonviolence movement faded as the gang's name was altered to &quot;Black P. Stone Nation&quot; Hairston's incarceration led Jeff Fort to take sole leadership of the gang, which by then stretched across numerous neighborhoods of the city and boasted as many as 50,000 members. During this time, the Stones became more political and more involved in community power structure. It even received funding from the US Office Of Economic Opportunity to run a job-training program in Woodlawn, the pilfering of which led Fort to another prison sentence. While jailed, Fort was influenced by the [[Nation of Islam]] and upon his release renamed the gang again, to the El Rukn Tribe Of The Moorish Science Temple of America, usually shortened to El Rukns. The gang, whose home territory is in between the &quot;-Stone streets&quot; of Blackstone Avenue and [[Stony Island Avenue]], are still a very strong force in the Woodlawn community.

The kids don't go to the city beaches and use the fire hydrants to cool off instead. It's a tradition in the community, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} very low income people. The area has high crime and fire records. From 1960 to 1970 the percentage of Chicago blacks with income of $7,000 or more jumped from 26% to 58%.&quot; - June 1973. Photograph by [[John H White (photojournalist)|John H. White]].]]

The area between 59th and 60th Streets is known as the [[Midway Plaisance]], incorporating Midway Plaisance North (south of 59th Street) and Midway Plaisance South, north of 60th Street. Now dominated by a green space of low valleys, the Plaisance is widely known as the site of the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]], in which the green space was to be designated as the Fair location (but was never utilized). The Plaisance is now a well-maintained walking and bike riding thoroughfare amidst the University's campuses. Between 60th and 61st Streets (with Stony Island Avenue to the east and Cottage Grove Avenue to the west) are several of the University's South Campus buildings including: University of Chicago Press, the [[University of Chicago Law School|law quadrangle and law library]], the [[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration|School of Social Service Administration]], the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]], the [[National Opinion Research Center]], the Center for Research Libraries, Chapin Hall, and Granville-Grossman Residential Commons. Some of the University's faculty and several hundred of its graduate and undergraduate students live south of 60th Street in University-owned real estate and dormitories, as well as in privately owned residences.

Chicago has made great strides into stabilizing as a neighborhood and community{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. There are many new hopeful developments and infill projects as greater education and more stable income slowly drips back into the area. The University of Chicago formerly had a &quot;stance&quot; on the neighboring communities to help inform students of stable and safe areas. Namely, students were encouraged to avoid any area south of 60th Street. Before officially abandoning such &quot;stances,&quot; the University's stance on Woodlawn changed to allow that it was a generally stable and safe area, which seems to match{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} a general trend of the improvement of the South Side of Chicago. Yet, at the same time, some{{Who|date=June 2008}} at the University argue that the best policy towards Woodlawn should be one of showing no economic quarter to those who oppose the Universities' expansion. Subsequently, there exists a level of tension between some of the residents of Woodlawn{{Who|date=June 2008}} against the University, despite a long-standing promise by the University not to expand south of 61st.

To replace the decaying [[Shoreland Hotel]], the University of Chicago constructed a new residence hall on the corner of 61st St. and Ellis, designed with input from residents of both Hyde Park and Woodlawn so as to minimize possible alienation of the neighboring community (which could occur via blank walls, etc.). Some see this as an attempt by the University to encroach upon Woodlawn{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, but it remains to be seen how this new development will affect Woodlawn residents. University police patrols extend three blocks farther south than the new dormitory, to 64th Street.

=== Jackson Park ===
[[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] is a 500-acre (2&amp;nbsp;km²) park on [[Lake Michigan]] in the neighborhoods of Woodlawn, [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], and bordering [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]].

The land for Jackson Park  was set aside in the 1870s. The area was originally a &quot;rough, tangled stretch of bog and dune&quot; until it was transformed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the architect of [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]].  The park is connected by the [[Midway Plaisance]] to Washington Park on Woodlawn's North end.

Jackson Park was the site of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. For this event, hundreds of acres of undeveloped park was turned into the spectacular, but temporary, [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] &quot;White City.&quot;  A small number of structures built for or used during the fair still remain in the park.

Attractions inside Jackson Park include Osaka Garden, the Jackson Park Golf Course, Jackson Park Harbor, Wooded Isle, the gilded [[Daniel Chester French]] statue Republic (a replica of a much larger statue built for the Columbian Exposition), several lagoons, and the [[Chicago beaches|63rd Street Beach]] with its magnificent beach house.

'''The Center for Middle Eastern Studies''' at the [[University of Chicago]] is a National Resource Center for the study of a region extending from [[Morocco]] in the West to [[Kazakhstan]] in the East.  As a result, this Area Center covers some of the most important and controversial regions - including [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]].  Prior to the Center's formation, scholars originally received funding administered by Title VI of the US Department of Defense's [[National Defense Education Act]].  The University of Chicago did not form its center until 1965, well after the administration of funding was moved to the US Department of Education by President [[John F. Kennedy]].  This area center consistently ranks in the highest tier of those dealing with [[Middle Eastern studies]] in the United States according to [[US Department of Education]] and external reviews. In the most recent competition for Department of Education's Title VI funds in 2014, the Center was awarded both NRC (National Resource Center) and FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies) grants, which support courses, extracurricular programs, educational outreach, and graduate student fellowships.

==Center functions==
The primary function of the Center is to serve as a meeting-place and a forum for all University members dealing with the [[Middle East]], regardless of discipline.  This is done informally in the social atmosphere of the [[Fazlur Rahman]] Common Room, as well as in formal settings, such as the Center's debates and sponsored colloquia.  The Center also serves as the clearinghouse for all manner of Middle Eastern content for the mid-West region.

==Masters of arts program==
The Center also administers a two-year terminal master's degree through either the Division of Humanities or the Division of Social Science, wherein a student may structure his or her own course of study in such areas as contemporary Middle Eastern studies, Middle Eastern history, Islamic studies, Islamic art and archaeology, and Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, or Turkic languages (Anatolian [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]), and their accompanying literatures. In the academic year 2006-07, the MA program was the largest such program in the country.  Currently (2007–08), it continues to be among the largest and most competitive programs in the United States.

Additionally, the Center offers a series of joint Masters of Arts programs.  These include:

'''M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies/Masters in Business Administration''' - in conjunction with the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]

'''M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies/Masters in Public Policy''' - offered with the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies|Irving B. Harris School of Public Policy Studies]] at the University of Chicago

The '''University of Chicago Persian antiquities dispute''' (بحران آثار باستانی ایرانی دانشگاه شیکاگو   ''in [[Persian language|Persian]]'') refers to a lawsuit by victims and relatives of victims of alleged Iranian state-sponsored terrorism to seize [[Persepolis Fortification Archive|historic Persian antiquities]] kept at the [[University of Chicago]], and numerous other Persian antiquities kept in the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in Chicago, as being Iranian government assets held within the jurisdiction of United States courts. It has been seen by Iranians as a perceived example of the hostility of United States federal court system toward [[Iranian people]] and Persian heritage.

== Background ==
In 2003, a group of victims of a September 4, 1997 explosion in [[Israel]] (a suicide bombing in [[Ben Yehuda Street Bombing#1997 bombing|Ben Yehuda mall]] in [[Jerusalem]]) won $71 million in a judgment in a U.S. court against Iran &lt;ref name=Sun-Times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-uofc27.html |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Andrew |last=Herrmann |date=2006-06-27 |title=Victims claim win in fight for U. of C. tablets |accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farsnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8504070161 |title=Iranian Antiquities May Be Seized in Suit |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for being a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tribunearticle&gt;{{cite news |title=Persian treasure trove on the line at U. of C. |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2006-06-28 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-28/news/0606280242_1_iran-court-s-ruling-chicago-case |first=Ron |last=Grossman |accessdate=2006-07-27}} (requires registration)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hamas]] had claimed responsibility for the attack, so some American visitors filed the federal lawsuit against Iran and Iranian officials, claiming that Hamas was financed by Iran, making the country legally responsible for their suffering.&lt;ref name=Tribunearticle /&gt; The case is formally called ''Jenny Rubin, et al. vs. the Islamic Republic of Iran, et al.''&lt;ref name=Tribunearticle /&gt;

After Iran ignored the judgment, Judge [[Ricardo M. Urbina]] issued a [[default judgment]] for the plaintiffs, awarding them $423.5 million in damages.,&lt;ref name=Tribunearticle /&gt; including $300 million in [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name=Allied&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran, U.S. Allied in Protecting Artifacts |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2006-07-18 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/17/AR2006071701177.html |first=Peter |last=Slevin |page=A03 |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the verdict, the question was how to collect. The former monarchy of Iran had billions of dollars in assets within the United States that were frozen after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. However, in order to secure an end to the [[Iranian Hostage Crisis]], the assets were unfrozen and most if not all of it, was collected by 1982 due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Rhode Island attorney David J. Strachman, along with other attorneys, representing the plaintiffs, found that the late [[The Shah|Shah]] had purchased a home in [[Lubbock, Texas]] for his son, which was sold for $400,000;.&lt;ref name=Allied /&gt; After that, they attempted to go after assets of Iranians who had previously worked for the former monarchy, but the U.S. courts would overturn all their attempts to seize their assets, as they were not found to be liable for the damages. They then went after Iranian-owned objects held by U.S. museums in [[Illinois]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Sun-Times /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allied /&gt; The Oriental Institute and its holdings from [[Persepolis]] became a primary target.&lt;ref name=Allied /&gt; Strachman said collectors are interested in the antiquities, potentially for tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=Sun-Times /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farsnews /&gt;

The university had argued [[sovereign immunity]], i.e., under federal law, &quot;certain property owned by foreign governments is protected from court judgments.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sun-Times /&gt; The university was arguing that on Iran's behalf, saying that &quot;the Iranians were gun-shy because of bad experiences with the American legal system.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tribunearticle /&gt; The victims characterized the university and other institutions as defending Iran.&lt;ref name=Sun-Times /&gt;

== Ruling ==
In June 2006, U.S. District Court Judge [[Blanche M. Manning]] ruled that only Iran, which has not acknowledged the suit, can claim its own rights.&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;  Manning said that the university's &quot;brazen accusation that the courts of the United States are hostile to Iran and that, as a result, Iran should be excused from bothering to assert its rights, is wholly unsupported.&quot;&lt;ref name = Tribunearticle/&gt;

The university however, in light of the new ruling, has argued that seizing the tablets would frighten foreign museums away from loans to U.S. institutions, and that U.S.-owned objects overseas might also be seized.&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsnews/&gt;

Appeals courts later reversed Manning's decision, however, ruling in favor of the Oriental Institute in 2011 and again in 2014. OI director [[Gil Stein (archaeologist)|Gil Stein]] explained that the new ruling was based on the idea that the tablets were to be considered noncommercial and thus not subject to seizure.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/04/15/oriental-institute-wins-lawsuit-keeps-iranian-tablets/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on University of Chicago's artifacts ==
The [[Achaemenid]] (or [[Persepolis]]&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;) clay tablets were loaned to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1937.&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/04/040428.tablets.shtml | title = University of Chicago returns ancient Persian tablets loaned by Iran | date = 2004-04-29 | accessdate = 2006-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were discovered by archaeologists in 1933 and are legally the property of the [[National Museum of Iran]] and the [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]].&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsnews/&gt;  The artifacts came with the understanding that they would be returned to Iran.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;  The tablets, from [[Persepolis]], the capital of the [[Persian Empire]], date to about [[500 B.C.]]&lt;ref name = Sun-Times /&gt;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease/&gt;

The tablets give a view of daily life, with things like daily rations of barley that were given to workers in nearby regions of the empire. These tablets were sent to the capital to keep track of how they were paying workers.&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;  [[Gil Stein (archaeologist)|Gil Stein]], director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, said that details largely concern food for people on diplomatic or military missions.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;  Each tablet is about half the size of a deck of [[playing card]]s and has characters of a dialect of [[Elamite]], an [[extinct language]] understood by perhaps a dozen scholars in the world.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

Stein called it &quot;the first chance to hear the Persians speaking of their own empire.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;  Charles Jones, Research Associate and Librarian at the Oriental Institute and tablet expert compared them to &quot;credit card receipts.&quot;&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease /&gt;  Most of our current knowledge about the ancient Persian empire comes from the accounts of others, most famously the Greek storyteller [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;  Stein added, &quot;It's valuable because it's a group of tablets, thousands of them from the same archive. It's like the same filing cabinet. They're very, very valuable scientifically.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

The university's [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] had been returning them to Iran in small batches.&lt;ref name = Sun-Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsnews/&gt;&lt;ref name = Chicagorelease/&gt;  The Institute had already returned 37,000 tablets and fragments to Iran and were preparing another shipment when Strachman intervened.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

== Field Museum case ==
The case of [[Field Museum of Natural History|Chicago's Field Museum]] is however different. It faces a similar lawsuit, but argues that its Persian collection was bought on the open market and is not owned by [[Iran]].&lt;ref name = Sun-Times /&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsnews /&gt;

== Larger international impact ==
According to the [[UNESCO]] &quot;''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property''&quot;, transfer of ownership of any and all Persian antiques is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/unesco01.html | title = Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property | work = [[UNESCO]] | date = 1970-11-17 | accessdate = 2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717062128/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/unesco01.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 10, 2006, [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Koichiro Matsuura]] said the U.S. court decision was &quot;illegal.&quot;&lt;ref name = RFERL&gt;{{cite news | title = Iran: Tehran, U.S. Academics Challenge Seizure Of Persian Tablets | url = http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/07/e0f6751e-a78c-4f60-8b1d-95237710906d.html | first = Golnaz | last = Esfandiari | date = 2006-07-12 | publisher = [[RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty]] | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US government position ===
The executive branch of the US government, in particular the [[US State Department]] have been supportive of the Iranian government's position in this case, arguing like the University of Chicago that the artifacts are protected under the sovereign immunity doctrine.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

As in several other cases involving U.S. citizens and foreign nations, the [[United States Department of Justice]] argued that [[national interest]] is better served if such disputes are resolved through diplomatic negotiations rather than legal suit.&lt;ref name = Tribunearticle /&gt;  Poking fun at the United States government, Manning wrote that &quot;[t]he government relegates the [key] argument to a footnote.&quot;&lt;ref name = Tribunearticle /&gt;

=== Iranian response ===
Iran has strongly condemned a U.S. court ruling authorizing the seizure of ancient clay tablets. In late June 2006, [[Manouchehr Mottaki]], Iran's [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], warned that &quot;if the US denies Iran's right to its properties and assets to satisfy judgments by some of its court, Tehran will reciprocate the action.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; Other officials expressed outrage, too, saying they will appeal to the International Court of Justice, UNESCO, and other international bodies.&lt;ref name = RFERL/&gt;

Iranian Foreign Minister said &quot;one of Americans' usual propaganda ploys is raising claims at the US courts based on the country's civil laws, which is contrary to the international law.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  He said that Iran had adopted a similar law in 1999.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  This has resulted in complaints against the United States for such things as its role in [[Operation Ajax]] and the [[Iran–Iraq War]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  So far, three billion dollars in penalties have been issued against the US government.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Mottaki says that Iran would follow up the case with UNESCO.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In September 2006 former [[Iranian President]] [[Mohammad Khatami]] met with Oriental Institute director Gil Stein and U. of C. provost Richard Saller to discuss the future of the tablets. Iran has characterized the situation as a U.S.-engineered heist. Khatami argued that the tablets &quot;do not belong to governments but to the Iranian nation and the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060906/ai_n16705962 | title = Iranian official sees disputed relics | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Andrew | last = Herrmann | date = 2006-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian embassies around the world condemned the ruling, which they say violates international norms and regulations.&lt;ref name = RFERL/&gt;  The Iranian [[embassy]] in [[Thailand]] strongly criticized a US federal court order to auction more than 30,000 clay tablets obtained during excavations in the Persepolis in 1935 and placed in the University of Chicago's museum on loan. The embassy's statement reads: &quot;The tablets were transferred to the US and delivered to the institute as part of the cultural heritage of the Iranian people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian embassy in Thailand blasts US federal court's ruling on Iran's cultural artifacts |date=2006-07-06 |publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]] |url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-20/0607068680152930.htm |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708224554/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-20/0607068680152930.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3,000 Iranians living outside the country have signed a petition calling on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to step in to reverse the ruling. They argue that the Iranian people should not be punished for &quot;whatever the Islamic regime of Iran is doing in the international arena.&quot;&lt;ref name = RFERL/&gt;

[[Gil Stein (archaeologist)|Gil Stein]], director of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] at the University of Chicago said, &quot;The Iranians are understandably furious about this. You'd have to imagine how we would feel if we loaned the [[Liberty Bell]] to [[Russia]] and a [[Russian court]] put it up for auction.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt; [[Farah Pahlavi]], former empress of Iran who is not tied to the current [[government of Iran]], has also voiced her strong objection to Strachman's efforts to seize the tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of [[Farah Pahlavi]] to  [[Koichiro Matsuura]], Director General of [[UNESCO]], July 4, 2006.

In response to Iran's reaction, Strachman said that Iranian commentators had been going into &quot;crazy conspiracy theories&quot;, including calling it a [[Zionist]] conspiracy.&quot;&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

In early July 2006, following the decision, Iran sent Washington lawyer [[Thomas Corcoran, Jr.|Thomas Corcoran]] to Chicago after years of refusing to participate in either the original terrorism case or the Chicago artifacts litigation, to assert Iran's immunities.  Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural property law specialist at [[DePaul University]], said that Corcoran's appearance changes matters greatly, as the crux of the judge's ruling was that Iran had to assert sovereign immunity itself.  &quot;It changes things pretty dramatically. If foreign sovereign immunity can be asserted, the case should be more or less resolved,&quot; she said.&lt;ref name = Allied/&gt;

The '''Uncommon Application''' was an application created by [[The University of Chicago]] in response to the growing homogenization of College Applications in the [[Common Application]] System.  However, as of the 2011-12 Freshman class, this has been dismantled, and instead Chicago asks for an &quot;uncommon&quot; supplement on the Common Application.

The '''Center for Research in Security Prices''' ('''CRSP''') is a provider of [[historical]] [[stock market]] data. The Center is a part of the [[Booth School of Business]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. CRSP maintains some of the largest and most comprehensive [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] historical [[database]]s in stock market research. Academic researchers and investment professionals rely on CRSP for accurate, [[survivor bias]]-free information which provides a foundation for their research and analyses. As of 2006, CRSP claims almost 500 clients. The name is usually pronounced &quot;crisp&quot;.

CRSP was founded in 1960 by [[James H. Lorie]] (professor of finance and director of research) and [[Lawrence Fisher]] (assistant professor of finance) of the University of Chicago, with a grant from [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith]]. Its goal was to provide a source of accurate and comprehensive data that could be used to answer basic questions about the behavior of stock markets. The first effort of the Center was the production of a database consisting of monthly stock prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] for all [[common stock]]s from 1926 to 1962. [[Dividend]]s, [[shares outstanding]], capital changes, and delisting information was also included. Taken together, this data made possible the first comprehensive study of the rates of return on common stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Lorie, &quot;Rates of Return on Investments in Common Stocks&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the database has been kept up to date to the present day, daily data has been expanded back to 1926, and other exchanges and financial instruments have been added.
 
CRSP's flagship databases include:
* Common stocks on the [[NYSE]] from 1926, [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]] from 1962, and [[NASDAQ]] from 1972
* CRSP Indices
* NASDAQ and [[S&amp;P 500]] Composite Indices
* NASDAQ and AMEX Industry Indices
* US [[Treasury bonds]]
* Survivor bias-free [[mutual funds]]
* [[Market capitalization]] reports;
* Proxy graphs for [[Form 10-K|10-K]] [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filings
* Other custom datasets
In partnership with [[Compustat]], CRSP provides the CRSP/Compustat Merged Database, and in partnership with the Ziman School of Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson School of Business, the CRSP/Ziman [[REIT]] Data Series.

The '''[http://www.cfsp.org/ Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty]''' (CFSP) is a private economic research consortium dedicated to studying the interaction of financial systems and poverty, using a variety of economic approaches in a range of developing countries.

The CFSP was established in 2009 by a grant to the University of Chicago from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Robert M. Townsend]] ([[MIT]]) as Principal Investigator, and economists Juliano Assuncao ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro|PUC-Rio]]), [[Abhijit Banerjee]] ([[MIT]]), Francisco Buera ([[UCLA]]), [[Diamond-Dybvig model|Douglas Diamond]] ([[Booth School of Business]]), Weerachart Kilenthong ([[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]]), Gabriel de Abreu Madeira ([[University of São Paulo]]), Roberto Rigobon ([[MIT Sloan School of Management]]), [[Kenneth Singleton]] ([[Stanford]]), Tavneet Suri ([[MIT]]), Christopher Udry ([[Yale]]), Christopher Woodruff ([[UCSD]]) as members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfsp.org/about/members&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFSP shares members with several other organizations that work in [[development economics]], including the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]], the [[Financial Access Initiative]], and [[Innovations for Poverty Action]]. In contrast to these organizations, however, which tend to focus on rigorous [[randomized evaluation]]s to generate policy recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.povertyactionlab.org/methodology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://financialaccess.org/research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://poverty-action.org/about/mission&lt;/ref&gt; the CFSP attempts to connect traditional approaches in developmental economics to a wider range of approaches and models, including [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium models]] applied to both macro and regional financial systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfsp.org/about/about-consortium/cfsp-vision-statement&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chicago Maroon''''', the independent student [[newspaper]] of the [[University of Chicago]], is a twice-weekly publication that traces its founding to 1892. During autumn, winter, and spring quarters of the academic year, the ''Maroon'' publishes every Tuesday and Friday. The paper consists of four sections: news, opinion (&quot;Viewpoints&quot;), arts, and sports. In the late summer, it publishes its annual orientation Issue (O-Issue) for entering first-year students, including sections on the University and the city of Chicago.

==About ''The Maroon''==
[[File:The Chicago Maroon business office.jpg|thumb|''The Chicago Maroon'' business office in [[Ida Noyes Hall]]]]
Any student at the University of Chicago can contribute to the newspaper, and many go through training and complete a series of requirements to join the ''Maroon'' as a staff member. Although the requirements have changed over time, the process of joining staff has traditionally been called &quot;hustling.&quot; The editorial board explained in 1903 that when the newspaper changed from a weekly to a daily, many more students were needed to produce the paper, so they &quot;hustled&quot; (meaning both &quot;to sell or promote energetically and aggressively&quot; and &quot;to convey forcibly or hurriedly&quot;) new writers and editors from the student body.

The executive board of the ''Maroon'' is effectively its [[Editor-in-Chief]] and [[Managing Editor]], which are elected in the spring by the newspaper's entire staff. There are roughly twenty editors that control the content and production of the different sections. Unsigned opinion articles are written by ''The Maroon [[Editorial Board]]'', which consists of the editors of the paper. The ''Maroon'' Advisory Board consists of a handful of University of Chicago faculty members and administrators that meet quarterly to review the newspaper's finances. ''The Chicago Maroon'' is financially and editorially independent from the university.

Over its history the ''Maroon'' served as publisher of other independent papers at the University of Chicago, including the ''Grey City Journal'', a weekly journal of arts and culture which featured some of the first cultural criticism by [[Thomas Frank]], the ''Chicago Literary Review'', a quarterly  showcase for poetry and short fiction, and ''The Fourth Estate'', the &quot;Conservative Brother Publication of the ''Chicago Maroon''.&quot; Currently, the ''Maroon'' publishes every Tuesday and Friday, and prints ''Grey City,'' its twice-quarterly long-form supplement to the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
''The Chicago Maroon'' has gone through many variations and formats, but considers 1892 to be the year of its establishment. It remains the only student organization at the University of Chicago that can trace its history to the first day the University of Chicago opened its doors to students.

===''The University of Chicago Weekly''===
A report on the history of the ''Maroon'' compiled for its centennial celebration begins, &quot;When the U of C opened in October 1892, students were already on campus selling the ''U of C Weekly'',&quot; which was the parent publication of the ''Maroon'' in its current form. ''The Weekly'' was established by two graduate students, Emory Forster and Jack Durno, and served as a student-run news and literary publication, even though it was owned by a local businessman.

Several publications were attempted in the first decade of the university's operation, but ''The Weekly'' was the only one that managed to stay afloat. The first of these abortive efforts was ''The Maroon'', a daily paper published from October 17, 1892 to April 19, 1893. The next attempt was a thrice-weekly newspaper, also called ''The Maroon'', which published from May 15, 1895 to March 20, 1896. The last was another daily, this time called ''The Daily Maroon'', whose founding was plagued with difficulties: Days after its first printing on May 7, 1900, the Faculty Board of Student Organizations suspended the publication because &quot;the editors were duped into printing a supposed scandal.&quot;{{Cite quote|date=February 2014}} After another failed effort later that spring, ''The Daily Maroon'' died for a second and final time.

According to one ''Weekly'' editor, &quot;its contents filled the space of about 16 to 24 pages and included articles about the old University, the faculty members, future plans, athletics, various student activities, and so-called verse.&quot;{{Cite quote|date=February 2014}} Although it was the largest paper available to students, and the only one that was financially successful, its editors believed that the university – which was quickly developing into a premier institution – was in need of a stable daily newspaper.

===''The Daily Maroon''===
Herbert Fleming (A.B. 1902) and Byron Moon, ''The Weekly''{{-'}}s managing editor and owner/publisher respectively, proposed to University President [[William Rainey Harper]] a merger between ''The Weekly'' and ''The Daily Maroon''. Harper accepted the proposal, with the condition that the paper would be financially autonomous from the University. Moon and Fleming, along with eight others, were appointed by the Board of Student Organizations to the Board of Control. Together, they persuaded the Alumni Association to front the necessary funds to start publishing, with the proposal that the paper should be owned by the entire student body. The ten members of the Board of Control assumed all other financial responsibility for the paper's first year, with profits or losses being divided equally.

''The Weekly'' stopped printing the same day ''The Daily Maroon'' started, choosing to &quot;close its career on October 1, 1902 to make room for its successors.&quot; During its first decade, ''The Daily Maroon'' focused on raising student enthusiasm for sports teams, and served as a bulletin board and calendar for social activities. Headlines consistently trumpeted the &quot;Monsters of the Midway's&quot; upcoming games, reviewed old ones, and printed new sports cheers and poems honoring the university.

In 1906, when the university won the national college football championship, ''The Daily Maroon'' joined the festivities by printing the story in maroon and black. That year, the paper began printing in the morning, instead of afternoon, so students and faculty could read it during breakfast.

===''The Maroon''===
During [[World War II]], printing a daily newspaper became infeasible because of both staff writers leaving the university to fight and decreased financial support during hard times. ''The Daily Maroon'' was changed to a weekly format, called ''The Maroon'', in 1942. The inaugural issue began with an editorial by Phil Rieff, the Editor-in-Chief:

&quot;And so we go to Press. Smaller. Fewer.
The ''Maroon'' is not what it used to be. But that is nothing to be sad about. We are sad because the ''Maroon'' is not what it should be. We had intended to publish twice a week. We had hopes of making the ''Maroon'' a significant organ of University opinion. We had even had gone so far as to contact certain faculty men and arrange for vital articles on contemporary issues. If we could serve the University, as a stimulus, a guide, an organ of critical thought during these critical times... That was our aim.&quot;

During these years, ''The Maroon'' was composed mainly of women, men too young to serve in the forces, and older men who were exempt from military service. The most notable change in the paper's appearance after the war was that it did not return to a daily, but printed Tuesdays and Fridays, which it continues to do. Its prewar structure, based on downtown Chicago newspapers, was not restored, and classes became the top priority for most staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Maroon'' also revised its distribution during that time. When it first appeared in 1902, it cost two cents an issue to defray the costs of printing. The price gradually increased to 5 cents by the 1940s. On June 27, 1947 ''The Maroon'' was distributed free of charge &quot;in order to assure the widest possible distribution.&quot; Increased ad revenue and financial support from the administration helped offset the losses from becoming non-subscription-based. In 1957, the paper also moved to [[Ida Noyes Hall]], its current location, from Lexington Hall, which is no longer standing.

When [[David Broder]] was elected Editor-in-Chief in 1948, he put ''The Maroon'' on the path to recovery by publishing a daily bulletin on days the newspaper didn't print and increased circulation from 3,000 to 22,000.

''The Maroon'' became more political over the following decades, prompting the Dean of Students to force the removal of Editor-in-Chief Alan Kimmel in 1951 and hold a university-wide election for the position. The newspaper continued to be highly political in the 1960s, and was even considered militant. During a campus sit-in after the firing of a radical sociology professor, [[Marlene Dixon]], in 1968, ''The Maroon'' published daily and editors met with University President [[Edward Levi]] in his house while his office was being occupied by students.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, ''The Maroon'' focused printing a neutral newspaper with political sister publications. ''Grey City Journal'', which is now the newspaper's quarterly magazine, espoused liberal politics, opinion, and criticism. After gaining significant criticism, editor [[John Scalzi]] decided to create a conservative brother publication, ''The Fourth Estate'', to balance the paper ideologically. With these weekly sections, the paper grew to its largest size, but because the publications did not bring in their own ad revenue, ''The Maroon'' dropped them in the 1990s.

Recently, ''The Maroon'' won a Pacemaker Award in 2009, the Associated Collegiate Press’ highest honor, and has gone through several redesigns in print and online to improve the layout and create a more modern appeal.

}}The '''George Herbert Jones Laboratory''', at 5747 S. Ellis Avenue, [[Chicago, Illinois]], is a facility building of the [[University of Chicago]].  Room 405 of the building was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in May 1967.

The Jones Laboratory was built in 1928-1929 as facility and instructional space for the university's staff of research [[chemist]]s and graduate students in [[chemistry]].

As part of the U.S. War Department's [[Manhattan Project]], University of Chicago chemists began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element, [[plutonium]].  Room 405 was the site where, for the first time, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured on September 10, 1942.  This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's [[atomic weight]].

Physicist [[Glenn Seaborg]] said of this event: &quot;These memorable days will go down in scientific history to mark the first sight of a [[synthetic element]], and the first isolation of a weighable amount of an artificially produced [[isotope]] of any element.&quot;

The U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] remediated Jones Laboratory in the 1980s by studying and removing almost all of the building's World War II-era radioactive waste.  The remediation took place in 1982, 1983, and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lm.doe.gov/land/sites/il/university/university.htm |title=University of Chicago Site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408215033/http://www.lm.doe.gov/land/sites/il/university/university.htm|publisher=University of Chicago|archive-date=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although room 405 looks nothing like the original condition, the lobby of the laboratory maintains a collection of the specialized equipment used to perform the measurements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4000">Between 2008 and 2011, the '''Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''  was an academic center established at the [[University of Chicago]] as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary site for research in economics. The Institute aimed to advance, refine, and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, [[Milton Friedman]], who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis. The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Department of Economics, and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields. The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis--an approach exemplified by Friedman and others. 

The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post-doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create &quot;a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.”&lt;ref name=&quot;mfiannounce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=May 15, 2008 |title=University of Chicago economists to focus their pioneering research in new institute honoring the memory of Milton Friedman |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/05/15/university-chicago-economists-focus-their-pioneering-research-new-institute-honor }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university had initially planned to invest $200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations.

The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman, who was viewed as polarizing. The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute &quot;a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University&quot; and that the proposal reflected &quot;a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of 'economy and society'&quot;.&lt;ref name=corespetition&gt;http://www.miltonfriedmancores.org/cores/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new [[Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bfiannounce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Becker Friedman Institute established at University of Chicago |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/06/17/becker-friedman-institute-established-university-chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Chicago Law School''' is the graduate school of law at the [[University of Chicago]]. It was founded in 1902 by a coalition of donors led by [[John D. Rockefeller]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago (2012). [http://www.law.uchicago.edu/school/history History of the University of Chicago Law School].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranks Chicago fourth among U.S. law schools, and it is noted for its influence on the [[economic analysis of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/rankings|title=The Best Law Schools in America, Ranked|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Chicago Law School was ranked third in the country by the 2015 [[Above the Law (blog)|Above The Law]] Rankings, which ranks law schools based on employment outcomes such as quality of jobs, federal clerkships, and alumni satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/careers/2015-law-school-rankings/|title=The 2015 ATL Top 50 Law School Rankings|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago is ranked second by [[Brian Leiter]] of the University of Chicago Law School on the &quot;Top 15 Schools From Which the Most 'Prestigious' Law Firms Hire New Lawyers,&quot; and first for &quot;Faculty quality based on American Academy of Arts and Sciences Membership.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome to Brian Leiter's Law School Rankings|url = http://www.leiterrankings.com/new/index.shtml|website = www.leiterrankings.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked 12th in the 2016 [[QS World University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Law Schools in 2016|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/law-legal-studies#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|website=QS World University Rankings|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
University president [[William Rainey Harper]] requested assistance from the faculty of [[Harvard Law School]] in establishing a law school at Chicago, and [[Joseph Henry Beale]], then a professor at Harvard, was given a two-year leave of absence to serve as the first Dean of the law school. During that time Beale hired many of the first members of the law school faculty and left the fledgling school &quot;one of the best in the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williston, Samuel, &quot;Ben Dover: A Biographical Sketch&quot;,56 Harvard Law Review No. 5, p. 687-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law School experienced a period of profound growth and expansion under the leadership of Dean [[Edward Hirsch Levi]], AB 1932, JD 1935 (1945–1962). Levi later served as university Provost (1962–1968) and President (1968–1975), and then as [[United States Attorney General]] under President [[Gerald Ford]]. During his time at the Law School, Levi brought scholars to the faculty and supported the [[Committee on Social Thought]] graduate program.&lt;ref&gt;(Press Release) [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/00/000307.levi.shtml Edward H. Levi, former U.S. Attorney General, President Emeritus of the University and the Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Law School and the College, dies at 88].

The D'Angelo Law Library is part of the greater University of Chicago library system. Renovated in 2006, it features a second-story reading room. The Law Library is open 90 hours per week and employs the equivalent of 10 full-time librarians.  It has study space for 483, a wireless network, and 26 networked computers.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Admissions==
Admission to The University of Chicago Law School is highly selective. For the class entering in the fall of 2015, 900 out of 4,111 applicants (21.8%) were offered admission, with 183 matriculating. The 25th and 75th [[LSAT]] percentiles for the 2016 entering class were 166 and 172, respectively, with a median of 170. The 25th and 75th undergraduate [[GPA]] percentiles were 3.69 and 3.97, respectively, with a median of 3.90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/admissionsprofilecard2015-16.pdf]. UChicago Entering Class Data&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grading==

The University of Chicago Law School employs a grading system that places students on a scale of 155-186. The scale was 55-86 prior to 2003, but since then the school has utilized a prefix of &quot;1&quot; to eliminate confusion with the traditional 100 point [[grading scale]]. These numerical grades convert to the more familiar alphabetical scale roughly as follows: 155-159 = F, 160-167 = D, 168-173 = C, 174-179 = B, 180-186 = A. For classes of more than 10 students, professors are required to set the median grade at 177, with the number of grades above a 180 approximately equaling the number of grades below a 173.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In a 21 June 2010 article in [[The New York Times]], business writer [[Catherine Rampell]] criticized other schools' problems with grade inflation, but commended Chicago's system, saying &quot;[Chicago] has managed to maintain the integrity of its grades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2010-06-21|access-date = 2015-06-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Catherine|last = Rampell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student graduates &quot;with honors&quot; if a final average of 179 is attained, &quot;with high honors&quot; if a final average of 180.5 is attained, and &quot;with highest honors&quot; if a final average of 182 is attained. The last of these achievements is rare; typically only one student every few years will attain the requisite 182 average. Additionally, the Law School awards two honors at graduation that are based on class rank. Of the students who earned at the Law School at least 79 of the 105 credits required to graduate, the top 10% are elected to the &quot;[[Order of the Coif]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/Final%202011-2012%20Student%20Handbook%20with%209.15.2011%20Revision_0.pdf {{dead link|date = August 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Students finishing their first or second years in the top 5% of their class, or graduating in the top 10%, are honored as &quot;Kirkland and Ellis Scholars&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt; (a designation created in 2006 by a $7 million donation from the law firm of [[Kirkland &amp; Ellis]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Press Release) [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/060216.law.shtml Kirkland &amp; Ellis gives $7 million to University of Chicago Law School].

According to the Law School's official 2015 ABA-required disclosures, 92.1% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recent Graduate Employment Data {{!}} University of Chicago Law School|url = http://www.law.uchicago.edu/prospective/employmentdata|website = www.law.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and Organizations==

===Journals===
The Law School produces six professional journals, and three are student-run: The ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]],'' The ''[[Chicago Journal of International Law]],'' and The ''University of Chicago Legal Forum''. Students interested in membership on any of these journals participate in a writing competition at the end of first year. The Law Review selects 19 students for membership based on first year GPA (&quot;grade on&quot;), and 10 students for the quality of their writing competition submission (&quot;write on&quot;). The other two journals select members on the basis of writing competition submissions alone (without regard to GPA). All three student-run journals allow second and third year students to &quot;write on&quot; by submitting a piece of legal scholarship worthy of publication.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The ''[[Supreme Court Review]]'', published by the law school and overseen by faculty since the 1960s, is the most cited legal journal internationally with respect to commentary on the nation's highest court.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The faculty also oversees publication of the ''[[Journal of Law and Economics]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Legal Studies]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Academic Paper Series===
The Law School produces several series of academic papers, including the Public Law and Legal Theory Working Papers, the John M. Olin Program in Law &amp; Economics Working Papers, and the Maurice and Muriel Fulton Lectures. It also produces a series of occasional papers.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Architecture==

[[File:Daytime reflection 7-26-09.jpg|thumb|The Laird Bell Quadrangle]]

The law school was originally housed in Stuart Hall, a Gothic-style limestone building on the campus's main quadrangles. Needing more library and student space, the law school moved across the [[Midway Plaisance]] to its current, [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed building (next to what was then the headquarters of the [[American Bar Association]]) in October 1959. The building contains classrooms, the D'Angelo Law Library, faculty offices, and an auditorium and courtroom, arranged in a quadrangle around a fountain (mimicking the college Gothic architecture of the campus's main quadrangles). The year saw a number of celebrations of the law school's new home, including a filming of the [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] (then hosted by [[Barbara Walters]]) and appearances by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], Governor (and later Vice President) [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;law.uchicago.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/fall09/building Building a Future on a Strong Foundation | University of Chicago Law School]. Law.uchicago.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, and over the objections of the Saarinen family, the building was expanded to add office and library space (and the library renamed in honor of alumnus Dino D'Angelo). In 1998, a dedicated space for the law school's clinics, the Arthur Kane Center for Clinical Legal Education, as well as numerous additional classrooms, were constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;law.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt; The library, classrooms, offices, and fountain received an acclaimed and award-winning renovation, completed in 2008, notable for the preservation of most of Saarinen's structure at a time when many modernist buildings face demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122341764591312909.html Saarinen's Law School Wasn't Razed - WSJ.com].

'''Voices in Your Head''' is a student-run, co-ed [[a cappella]] group from the [[University of Chicago]]. Founded in 1998, the group consists of both undergraduate and graduate students whose studies range from Economics to Music to MD/PhD programs. Voices arranges all of its own music, spanning several genres. Its unique repertoire includes original pieces, as well as an eclectic mix of [[pop music|pop]], [[R&amp;B]], [[Rock music|rock]], and alternative music. Voices competes annually in the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA)]], and travels nationally for a cappella festivals and tours.

==History==

Voices in Your Head was formed in the fall of 1998. Amanda founded the group because she realized there were no 'funky' performance organizations at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;http://voicesinyourhead.org/?p=acappella/profile&amp;id;=28&lt;/ref&gt; They released their first live album, ''Sesquipedalia,'' in 2000, their first studio album, ''On Point,'' in 2002, and their second studio album, ‘’Songs for Padded Rooms,’’ in 2005.

‘'Note To Self',&quot; released on May 23, 2008, received a strong Recorded A Cappella Review Board review&lt;ref name=&quot;rarbreview&quot;&gt;[http://www.rarb.org/reviews/870.html] RARB review of Note To Self&lt;/ref&gt; and contained a track (“Magic”) selected for the 2008 edition of the international a cappella compilation, Voices Only.&lt;ref name=&quot;voicesonly2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.voicesonlyacappella.com/vo2008.html] Voices Only 2008 Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted author [[Nick Hornby]] also included &quot;Magic&quot; from ''Note To Self'' in his 2008 playlist for the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nickhornby&quot;&gt;[http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/living-with-music-a-playlist-by-nick-hornby/] Nick Hornby's 2008 Playlist&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2009, [[Ben Folds]] announced that &quot;Magic&quot; would appear on his 2009 album [[Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!]], calling it &quot;a hell of a cool place to live for three and a half minutes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;benfoldsacappella&quot;&gt;[http://benfolds.com/acappella] Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NBC Washington]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cbswashington&quot;&gt;[http://www.nbcwashington.com/around-town/archive/Album_Review__That_Ben_Folds_A_Cappella_Record.html] NBC Washington review&lt;/ref&gt; commented on the group's contribution, &quot;Magic,&quot; saying &quot;the arrangement is so different from the original that the song is a completely unique artifact–which should be the goal of any group, a cappella or otherwise, when attempting a cover.&quot; In an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly]],&lt;ref name=&quot;entertainmentweekly&quot;&gt;[http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/04/15/ben-folds-wacky/] Entertainment Weekly interview&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Folds]] commented: &quot;There’s a group from the University of Chicago called Voices in Your Head that sings 'Magic' on the record, and to me they’re in a different league from the rest of the groups.&quot; As part of the tour to support the album release, Voices in Your Head performed live with Ben Folds on March 19, 2009 in Milwaukee, WI at the [[Eagles Ballroom]].

That year, Voices In Your Head competed for the first time in the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]],&lt;ref name=&quot;icca2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsityvocals.com/acappella-events.html#ICCA%20Midwest] ICCA 2010 Midwest lineup&lt;/ref&gt; a competition featuring groups from all over the country and overseas. In 2011, Voices finished third at their Midwest Quarterfinal; in 2012, they came in first at both the quarterfinal and the semifinal, progressing to ICCA finals in New York City, where they finished fourth overall. In addition, they competed in the inaugural Boston Sings collegiate competition, where they came in first.&lt;ref name=&quot;boss2012&quot;&gt;[http://bostonsings.com/category/blog/competition-results/] BOSS 2012 Competition results&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's newest album, ''I Used to Live Alone'', was released on May 21, 2011, and marked Voices' emergence into the national a cappella scene. Several tracks met critical acclaim in the a cappella community up to a year before its release: the tracks &quot;I'd Like To,&quot; &quot;Boomerang&quot; and &quot;Sharp&quot; were all selected for national a cappella compilation albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;voicesonly2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.voicesonlyacappella.com/] Voices Only Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sing7tracklist&quot;&gt;[http://www.casa.org/content/sing-7-lucky-track-list] Sing 7 track list announcement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;singcompilationpage&quot;&gt;[http://www.casa.org/sing_cd] Sing Compilation official website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sing8tracklist&quot;&gt;[http://www.casa.org/sing8tracklist] Sing 8 track list announcement&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Boomerang&quot; was also the winner of the 2011 [[Contemporary A Cappella Recording Award|CARA (Contemporary A Cappella Recording Award)]] in the category of Best Scholastic Original. After its release, the album received positive reviews from the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB), and was selected as one of RARB's picks of the year. In 2012, &quot;I Used To Live Alone&quot; was nominated for five CARA awards, winning Best Mixed Collegiate Arrangement (Chris Rishel, for &quot;I'd Like To&quot;) and runner up places for Best Mixed Collegiate Album, Song, and Solo.

Voices returned to ICCA competition in 2014, falling short at the Midwest semifinal after placing second at the quarterfinal stage. The next year, however, after finishing first at their Midwest quarterfinal and semifinal, the group returned to Finals. The 2015 ICCA Finals, held on April 18 at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], saw Voices finish 2nd to the University of Southern California's [[SoCal VoCals]].

LIGHTS, the group's sixth studio album, was released in July 2016.

[[File:Saieh Hall for Economics.jpg|thumb|Saieh Hall for Economics, location of the Becker Friedman Institute]]
The '''Gary Becker Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''&lt;ref name=&quot;bfiannounce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Becker Friedman Institute established at University of Chicago |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/06/17/becker-friedman-institute-established-university-chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established at the [[University of Chicago]] in June 2011 as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary center for research in economics. It brought together the activities of two formerly independent economic research centers at the University:  the [[Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics]] and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory, founded by Richard O. Ryan, MBA ’66.

The institute is named for two globally influential economists: [[Gary S. Becker]] (1930–2014) and his mentor,  [[Milton Friedman]] (1912-2006), both winners of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. While they pursued different scholarly paths, Becker and Friedman shared a fundamental belief that economics, grounded in empirical research, is a powerful tool to understand human behavior. While Friedman is known for his lasting contributions to macroeconomics and monetary economics, Becker is recognized for extending microeconomic analysis to a wide range of fields and topics.

A collaboration of the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]], [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]], [http://economics.uchicago.edu/ Department of Economics], and the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies|Harris School for Public Policy]], the Institute builds bridges across disciplines and subfields of economics. Its research conferences, workshops, and initiatives bring economists and scholars from related fields together to share perspectives and refine ideas. The institute also sponsors an active visiting scholars program and offers programs and support for students and promising young researchers. 

The institute supports research initiatives in traditional Chicago strengths such as price theory, law and economics, and human capital, as well as topical inquiries into important policy issues such as fiscal imbalance, [[systemic risk]], [[policy uncertainty]], and economics of the family, and newer areas like field experiments in economics.

The institute is cochaired by [[Lars Peter Hansen]], a 2013 Nobel laureate who guides the intellectual agenda, and [[Kevin M. Murphy]], a distinguished microeconomist who focuses on public outreach activities  and development. An [https://bfi.uchicago.edu/about/leadership Institute Research Council] of distinguished faculty from collaborating university units advises the cochairs.

'''BiblioVault''' is a virtual warehouse for academic books that serves more than 90 scholarly publishers in the U.S. and Europe. 

Development began in late 2001 under the auspices of the [[University of Chicago Press]], with [[Finance|financial]] support from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. 

As of mid 2015, BiblioVault provided long-term secure storage for more than 40,000 digital book files from 110 publishers, and offered scanning, printing, transfer, conversion, file distribution, [[print on demand]] and ebook [[order fulfillment]] services to its members.

BiblioVault hosts a public web site, [//www.bibliovault.org bibliovault.org], with information about each title, including descriptions, cover thumbnails, tables of contents, excerpts, and reviews. The site links to member press shopping carts, for immediate online purchase of the books listed. Accessibility offices can request files for students with disabilities from these pages as well.

Member presses visit BiblioVault's publishers' site, to submit and retrieve their files, edit metadata about their titles, and order deliveries of files and metadata to e-retailers, search sites, and printers. BiblioVault is also associated with a digital [[printing]] center within the [[University_press#Chicago_Distribution_Center|Chicago Distribution Center]] for short-run printing (and automated physical warehouse restocking) of titles stored in the repository.

Besides making more than file deliveries to e-retailers, such as [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]'s [[Nook]], Apple's [[iBooks]], [[Google Play]], etc., BiblioVault also fulfills ebooks directly using [[Adobe Digital Editions]] for member presses, via the Chicago Distribution Center's online shopping cart and several other independent press shopping carts.

The '''Cowles Commission for Research in Economics''' is an [[economic]] [[research institute]], founded in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1932 by [[Alfred Cowles]], a businessman and economist. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the [[University of Chicago]] under the directorship of [[Theodore O. Yntema]]. [[Jacob Marschak]] took over as director in 1943 until 1948, when it was passed over to [[Tjalling C. Koopmans]]. Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at University of Chicago during the 1950s led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to [[Yale University]] in 1955 (where it was renamed the '''Cowles Foundation''').{{ref|newschool}}

As its motto (''Theory and Measurement'') indicates, the Cowles Commission was dedicated to the pursuit of linking [[economic theory]] to mathematics and statistics. Its main contributions to economics lie in its creation and consolidation of two important fields: [[general equilibrium theory]] and [[econometrics]].

The thrust of the Cowles approach was a specific, probabilistic framework in estimating [[simultaneous equations]] to model an economy.  Its ultimate goal in doing so was to gain policy insight.  The Cowles approach structured its models from a priori economic theory.  One of its main contributions was in exposing the bias of ordinary least squares regression in identifying coefficient estimates.  Consequently, Cowles researchers developed new methods such as the indirect least squares, instrumental variable methods, full information maximum likelihood method, and limited information maximum likelihood method.  All of these methods used theoretical, a priori restrictions. According to an article by Carl F. Christ, the Cowles approach was grounded on the following assumptions: 1, simultaneous economic behavior; 2, linear or logarithmic equations and disturbances; 3, systematic, observable variables without error; 4, discrete variable changes as opposed to continuous; 5, a prior determination of exogeneity and endogeneity; 6, the existence of a reduced form; 7, independence of the explanatory variables; 8, a priori identified structural equations; 9, normally distributed disturbances with zero means, finite and constant covariances, a nonsingular covariance matrix, and serial independence; 10, a dynamically stable system of equations.{{ref|Christ}}

Several Cowles associates have won [[Nobel prize]]s for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Gérard Debreu]], [[James Tobin]], [[Franco Modigliani]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], [[Lawrence Klein]], [[Trygve Haavelmo]], [[Leonid Hurwicz]] and [[Harry Markowitz]].

The Cowles Foundation is located at 30 [[Hillhouse Avenue]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

It is sponsored by the United States [[Federal Reserve Board]] in cooperation with the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]]. Since 1992, data have been collected by the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]], located in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Data from the survey are widely used, from analysis at the Federal Reserve and other branches of government to scholarly work at the major economic research centers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/survey-of-consumer-finances-SCF.aspx NORC Survey of Consumer Finance Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/178_60/fed-readies-survey-of-americans-consumer-finances-1057877-1.html Fed Readies Survey of Americans' Consumer Finances]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. However, because only about 4,500 to 6,500 families are interviewed in the main study, every family selected is very important to the results. In the 2004 survey, the median interview length was about eighty minutes. However, in some particularly complicated
cases, the amount of time needed was substantially more than two hours. The majority of interviews were obtained in person, although interviewers were allowed to conduct telephone interviews if that was more convenient for the respondent.

Wealth in the U.S. is relatively concentrated, with more than a third of the total being held by one percent of the population. In order to address issues relevant to the full distribution of wealth, the survey combines two techniques for [[random sampling]].

First, a standard [[Multistage sampling|multistage area-probability sample]] (a geographically based random sample) is selected to provide good coverage of characteristics, such as homeownership, that are broadly distributed in the population.

Second, a supplemental sample is selected to disproportionately include wealthy families, which hold a relatively large share of such thinly held assets as noncorporate businesses and tax-exempt bonds. Called the &quot;list sample&quot;, this group is drawn from a list of statistical records derived from tax returns. These records are used under strict rules governing confidentiality, the rights of potential respondents to refuse participation in the survey, and the types of information that can be made available. Individuals listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as being among the [[Forbes 400]] (the wealthiest 400 people in the U.S.) are excluded from sampling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/codebk2010.txt SCF Codebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[response rate (survey)|response rate]] in the area-probability sample is more than double that in the list sample. In both 2001 and 2004, about 70 percent of households selected for the area-probability sample actually completed interviews. The overall response rate in the list sample was about 30 percent; in the part of the list sample likely containing the wealthiest families, the response rate was only about 10 percent. To retain the scientific validity of the study, interviewers are not allowed to substitute respondents for families that do not participate. Thus, if a family declines to participate, it means that families like theirs may not be represented clearly in national discussions.

The survey interviews are conducted largely between the months of May and December in each survey year by NORC.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker, Jesse, Arthur B. Kennickell, Kevin B.

'''Ida Noyes Hall''' is a three-story, [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] building located on the University of Chicago campus in Chicago, Illinois. Designed by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] and completed in 1916, the building features fireplaces, a limestone exterior, intricately plastered ceilings, and elaborate wood paneling.

==History==
Ida Noyes Hall originally served as a women's clubhouse and gymnasium, and was built as a complement to the Reynolds Club and Hutchinson Commons, which provided social and recreational spaces for the men on campus. The construction of the building was made possible by a gift from La Verne Noyes in the memory of his late wife, Ida.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenHouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Ida Noyes Hall | publisher = ''http://www.openhousechicago.org/'' | url = http://www.openhousechicago.org/site/261/ | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WebExhibit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Ida Noyes Hall - A Center for Women on Campus | publisher = ''https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/'' | url = https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/OnEqualTerms/IdaNoyes.html | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ida Noyes, née Smith, was born in Croton, N.Y., in 1853, though her family relocated to Iowa in 1857. She graduated from [[Iowa State University]] with a degree in teaching in 1874 and married La Verne Noyes in 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ida Noyes Papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Guide to the Ida Noyes Papers | publisher = ''Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library'' | url = https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.NOYESPHOTOS | accessdate = 2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its opening, Ida Noyes Hall hosted public lectures, club meetings, and social events.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebExhibit&quot; /&gt;

In January 2005 a portrait of Ida Noyes, painted by [[Oliver Dennett Grover]] and donated to the building by La Verne Noyes, was stolen from the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtTheft&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Portrait of Ida Noyes vanishes without a trace | publisher = ''chicagomaroon.com'' | url = http://chicagomaroon.com/2005/01/25/portrait-of-ida-noyes-vanishes-without-a-trace/ | accessdate = 2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations==

In 1987, the gymnasium was converted into Max Palevsky Cinema. Since that time, [[Doc Films]] has screened movies every night of the academic year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Ida Noyes Hall | publisher = ''http://uchicago.edu/'' | url = https://studentactivities.uchicago.edu/facilities/inh.shtml | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the murals on the third floor, originally created in 1918 to commemorate the quarter centennial of the University of Chicago and the opening of Ida Noyes Hall, were restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuralRestoration&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Masque of Youth | publisher = ''http://magazine.uchicago.edu/'' | url = http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0110/campus-news/journal-city.html | accessdate = 2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MuralRestoration2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Conservators restore youth to Ida Noyes Hall mural | publisher = ''http://magazine.uchicago.edu/'' | url = http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9502/Feb95Journal.html | accessdate = 2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the building underwent repairs to address a crumbling facade and leaking roof, and in 2008, the University's [[Booth School of Business]] renovated the [[natatorium]] to create additional study space for student study groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Repairs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = FacadeRenovation | publisher = ''Chicago Maroon'' | url = http://chicagomaroon.com/2007/05/08/ida-noyes-renovation-to-fix-leaky-roof-aging-facade/ | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoolRenovation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Renovation | publisher = ''http://www.primerachicago.com'' | url = http://www.primerachicago.com/markets/higher_education/fp-2.php | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoolRenovation2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Renovation | publisher = ''Chicago Maroon'' | url = http://chicagomaroon.com/2008/02/12/ida-noyes-to-receive-further-upgrades/ | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">The '''Gordon J. Laing Award''' is conferred annually, by the [[University of Chicago]]'s Board of University Publications, on the faculty author, editor, or translator whose book has brought the greatest distinction to the list of the [[University of Chicago Press]]. The first award was given in 1963 and the 53rd and most recent award was given on April 21, 2016 to Amir Sufi, the Bruce Lindsey Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]].

The award is named in honor of the scholar who, serving as general editor of the Press from 1909 until 1940, firmly established the character and reputation of the Press as the premier academic publisher in the United States.

The award is presented each April at a ceremony at the [[Quadrangle Club (University of Chicago)]].

'''Burton–Judson Courts''' (B-J/The Beej) is a [[dormitory]] located on the [[University of Chicago]] campus. The [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic style]] structure was designed by the Philadelphia architectural firm of [[Zantzinger, Borie &amp; Medary]], and was completed in 1931 at a cost of $1,756,287.&lt;ref name=prid&gt;{{cite book|title=The University of Chicago: an architectural tour|author=Jay Pridmore, Peter Kiar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGyjEvWS6gC&amp;pg=PA104 |page=106|accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton–Judson Courts is built around two courtyards that are named after the university's second and third presidents, [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and [[Ernest DeWitt Burton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trishmorse.com/sixtieth.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430140059/http://www.trishmorse.com/sixtieth.htm |archivedate=2015-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton-Judson contains six houses: Dodd-Mead, Salisbury, Linn-Mathews, Coulter, Chamberlin, and Vincent. In addition to student rooms, the building contains  a library, lounge rooms, and apartments for resident heads and the resident masters.&lt;ref name=photoarchive1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoarchive.lib.uchicago.edu/db.xqy?one=apf2-01251.xml |title=Burton-Judson Courts |author=photoarchive.lib.uchicago.edu |year=1958 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amos Jerome Snell Hall and Charles Hitchcock Hall''', more commonly known as '''Snell–Hitchcock''', make up a [[residence hall]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. The dorm is on the northwest corner of the University's main quadrangles at the corner of 57th St. and Ellis Avenue. It is connected via emergency exits to Searle Chemistry Laboratory. Built in 1892 (Snell) and 1901 (Hitchcock), they are the oldest residence halls still in use as such on the university's campus. Snell is built in a Collegiate Gothic style, while Hitchcock is Prairie Style-inspired Gothic. The buildings feature fireplaces and exteriors of limestone, as well as hardwood molding and trim.

Snell–Hitchcock is known for having a high level of community spirit and involvement, which are best displayed at the annual [[University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt]]. As of 2015, the Snell–Hitchcock team has won 14 of the 29 hunts to date, and holds the longest winning streak (four years) in the history of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scav&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/yore.html|title=Scav Hunt Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock was built in 1901, and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It is built in a [[Collegiate Gothic]] style, like Snell and most of the [[University of Chicago]]'s campus, but has many [[prairie|Prairie School]] elements, such as stone corn husks instead of gargoyles and flat-roofed instead of gabled dormers.&lt;ref name=block&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Jean F.|title=The Uses of Gothic Planning and Building the Campus of the University of Chicago, 1892–1932|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Library|isbn=0943056020|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock is built in the European &quot;landing&quot; style of dormitory with five stairwells linked through the front cloister and basement, though only the basement is used now in order to ensure that the building is more secure. The three interior &quot;sections&quot; ('''Sections II-IV''') are each built around a single staircase. Each interior Section consists of two floors of four double-rooms with a fourth floor that has two suites (doubles with a large living room and separate bedroom). Most of the rooms have non-working fireplaces. The first floor houses the apartment for the Resident Masters, a live-in faculty couple. Traditionally, each section has had a women-only and a men-only floor, with the suite floor being either single or mixed-sex depending on the desires of the residents.

The outermost sections of Hitchcock (Sections I &amp; V) house primarily upper-class students. They have small hallways with six to eight residents per floor, many in single rooms. '''Section I''' is the farthest from the front desk of Hitchcock and each floor is mixed-sex with a shared bathroom. It has some of the largest rooms in Hitchcock Hall, and includes several rooms known as &quot;octagons&quot; which are located in a turret-like structure and have many windows overlooking 57th and Ellis. The basement entrance to this section opens up into the common area that connects Snell and Hitchcock. Section I also contains &quot;horseshoe doubles&quot; (room #1x7), large doubles with separate niches and closets for each resident. The horseshoe doubles also have a (nonworking) fireplace and large hearth. Section I was also home to noted astronomer, Emmy award winner, and Pulitzer and Hugo award winning author [[Carl Sagan]] in the 1954–1955 academic year.

'''Section V''' is built above the Green Room, a large lounge, which is properly known as the Charles Hitchcock Memorial Library. Unlike Section I the first two floors are alternating single-sex (female, then male) with the top floor remaining mixed-sex. Section V has some of the more unusual rooms in Hitchcock, including several which have their own names.

On the second floor of section V is the &quot;Fermi Room,&quot; where [[Enrico Fermi]] is said to have lived while working on the [[Manhattan Project]] in the 1940s. It is rumored that he chose that room because it had its own bathroom with tub; though the bathroom remains, the tub was replaced with a shower in 2008. Linked to the Fermi Room is the Fermi Blackboard, which is said to be the same blackboard Fermi used to do his calculations, although this may be an [[urban legend]]. This possibility does not, nevertheless, detract from many students' desire to possess it.

On the fourth floor is &quot;The Ranch&quot; (room 541), a sprawling single which extends across the north side of the section. It overlooks the [[Regenstein Library]] and Ratner Athletic Center and on a clear day the [[Sears Tower]] can be seen in the distance. It is usually one of the most sought-after rooms in the House's annual housing lottery.

The main lounge in Hitchcock, the Green Room, is a large reading room with tiled floor, a grand piano, a working fireplace, and portraits of namesake Charles Hitchcock, benefactor Annie Hitchcock, and University of Chicago patron Daniel Shorey. Hitchcock also has a kitchen, a bike storage room, and a laundry room. Each section has its own door onto Hitchcock's cloister (known as the Arcade), but the doors are used for exiting only and all entry must be through the main entrance or from Snell. The Snell–Hitchcock front desk and mail room are located in Hitchcock's main entrance. Hitchcock has two assistant resident heads (RAs) and one set of Resident Heads, often a live-in graduate student couple.

==Snell Hall==
[[Image:Snell Hall.jpg|thumbnail|320px|Snell Hall]]
Built in 1892, Snell is half the size of Hitchcock, housing approximately 50 residents on four floors. It has the distinction of being one of the first women's dorms on a coeducational campus. In the beginning, it only housed women for two quarters; once the intended women's dorm opened, Snell was turned over to the men. All the rooms are singles, except for a two-room suite on the second floor. Three of the four floors are of mixed genders, while the third floor is women-only. A co-oped kitchen, laundry room, and a small recreational room are located in the basement, which connects with Hitchcock Hall. Until 2014, when it was closed, Snell residents could enter the hall through a separate door from the main hall doors.. Snell's main lounge is the Tea Room, an oak-paneled room with a non-working fireplace, copious selection of periodicals and, notably to residents, a dog-eared copy of [[John Rechy]]'s novel ''The Sexual Outlaw''. Snell resident assistant (RA) and one set of Resident Heads, often a live-in graduate student couple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">The '''Chicago Linguistic Society''' (or '''CLS''') is one of the oldest student-run organizations in the United States, based at the [[University of Chicago]].  Although its exact foundation date is obscure, according to [[Eric Hamp]] it is generally believed to antedate the Second World War, and possibly extends back to [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]]'s and [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]]'s tenure at the University in the 1920s and 1930s.   

Since the mid 1960s, CLS has run an annual conference that has received an international status in linguistics comparable to [[Berkeley Linguistic Society|BLS]], the [[Linguistic_Society_of_America|LSA]], [[West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics|WCCFL]] and [[North Eastern Linguistic Society|NELS]].

The '''Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society''' is an educational center located on the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

== History ==

The Neubauer Collegium was established in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interdisciplinary Collegium launches with multi-genre performance|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/10/06/interdisciplinary-collegium-launches-with-multi-genre-performance/|newspaper=The Chicago Maroon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Susie|title=Landmark Initiative Reimagines Humanistic Inquiry|url=http://www.uchicago.edu/features/20120627_collegium/|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded with a gift of $26.5-million  from [[Joseph Neubauer]], former CEO and chairman of [[Aramark Corporation]], and  [[Jeanette Lerman-Neubauer]], founder of the  Philadelphia marketing and communications firm, J.P. Lerman &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philanthropy.com/factfile/gifts_detail?GiftDonorJoin_a_DonorID=PGDON2160] Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/ref&gt;  A second major gift came from [[Emmanuel Roman]], CEO of the [[Man Group]] and a University of Chicago graduate in whose honor the head of the Collegium is named the Roman Family Director.&lt;ref&gt;Gift from Emmanuel Roman, MBA'87, to support Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society (University of Chicago) [http://article.wn.com/view/2013/10/01/Gift_from_Emmanuel_Roman_MBA87_to_support_Neubauer_Collegium/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noodls.com/view/8A83E291F7400BEB8724B2033C07D9DF5B1A09AD |title=University of Chicago (via noodls) / Gift from Emmanuel Roman, MBA'87, to support Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society |publisher=Noodls.com |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural cohort of 18 faculty research projects were announced in March 2013 and represent faculty from 17 departments, as well as the Chicago Booth School of Business, the Divinity School, the Law School, the Pritzker School of Medicine, and the Oriental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Susie|title=Neubauer Collegium selects inaugural research projects |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/03/04/neubauer-collegium-selects-inaugural-research-projects |publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campus ===

The collegium occupies an historic 16,000 sq. ft. [[Collegiate Gothic]] style building erected in 1933 as the home of the [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]], adjacent to the campus of the University of Chicago in Hyde Park which was purchased by the University in 2011 and was renovated by [[Kliment Halsband Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago Selects Kliment Halsband Architects to Design Home for Neubauer Collegium, University Business, May 2, 2013

'''''Cannon v. University of Chicago''''', 441 U.S. 677 (1979){{ref|citation}}, was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case which interpreted [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] silence in the face of earlier interpretations of similar laws to determine that [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act provides an [[implied cause of action]].

==Facts==
[[Plaintiff]] Geraldine Cannon sued the [[University of Chicago]], asserting that she was denied admission on the basis of her sex, and that she had a cause of action under Title IX, which bars sex discrimination by federally funded institutions, but does not expressly grant a private right of action. The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] dismissed the case. The dismissal was affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], which held that the statutory procedure for termination of federal funds was the exclusive remedy provided by Congress.

One issue, buried in footnotes, would be of importance in the subsequent ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'' decision. The University of Chicago claimed that Cannon was denied admission because the medical university admissions departments had a policy of not admitting applicants over thirty years of age, at least not without an advanced degree. Northwestern Medical School absolutely disqualified applicants over 35. Cannon was 39 years old at the time. The policy had a disparate impact on women. 

The plaintiff appealed, contending that Congress acted in light of similar language in [[Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VI]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which the Supreme Court had already found to imply a private remedy, and to which Congress had allowed [[attorney fees]] (which would be unnecessary absent a private right of action).

==Issue==
Did Congress intend a private remedy to be implied from the Title IX?  Are individuals allowed to sue under Title IX, or are they only allowed to participate in class-action suits by the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|HEW]]?

==Holding==
The Court, in an opinion by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], applied the four-part test set forth in ''[[Cort v. Ash]]'', 422 U.S. 66 (1975), used in order to determine whether Congress had meant for a law to be able to be privately enforced:
#  Is the plaintiff a member of a special class for whose benefit the statute was enacted? (The court notes that this can not be used to imply a right of action that is merely a criminal statute that prohibits all persons from engaging in a general prohibited behavior).
#  Does [[legislative history]] express a legislative intent to create or deny a private right of action?
#  Would creation of a private right of action frustrate legislative scheme, or is it in fact helpful to it?
#  Does the right involve an area that historically has basically been of concern to the States?
The court determined that all of the ''Cort'' factors pointed to an implied right of action:
#  Women are clearly in the special class protected by the statute, for the statute identifies persons who shall not be excluded.
#  Title IX contained language which copied that of Title VI, for which a private cause of action had already been implied by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] at the time Title IX was adopted; this was held to show legislative intent.
#  The remedy was necessary, or at least helpful to accomplishing one of Congress’ two purposes: avoiding federal support for discriminators ''and'' protecting individual citizens from discrimination. Private suits make this second purpose easier to implement.
#  This question is not left to states because the federal government is primarily responsible for protecting against [[discrimination]].
The Court also recognized that while this new source of financial liability might affect universities badly, it was up to Congress to weigh that concern.

==Dissent==
A dissenting opinion by Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]] raised [[separation of powers]] concerns. He called the Court's decision legislation, noting that Congress knew how to make judicial remedies, and saying that three of the four factors invited judicial lawmaking&amp;mdash;only the second factor, he argued, was really about congressional intent. Powell contended that the Court's decision would encourage Congress to be lax in their duty to create laws, expecting democratically unaccountable judges to do the job for them.

The '''Frederick C. Robie House''' is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] on the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] in the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] [[neighborhood]] of [[Hyde Park, Illinois|Hyde Park]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], at 5757 S. Woodlawn Avenue. Built between 1909 and 1910, the building was designed by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and is renowned as the greatest example of the [[Prairie School]] style, the first architectural style considered uniquely American. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on November&amp;nbsp;27, 1963&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Robie House, NHL Database, National Historic Landmarks Program. Retrieved February&amp;nbsp;9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and was on the very first [[National Register of Historic Places]] list of October&amp;nbsp;15, 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

==History==
Wright designed the Robie House in his [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] between 1908 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,&quot; Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984, p. 19-25.  See also [http://www.wrightplus.org/robiehouse/robiehouse.html Robie House], Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, Retrieved January 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The design precedent for the Robie House was the [[F.F. Tomek House|Ferdinand F. Tomek House]] in Riverside, Illinois, designed by Wright in 1907-08.&lt;ref&gt;Id., pp. 16-17. See &quot;Down to Earth: An Insider's View of Frank Lloyd Wright's Tomek House,&quot; Moran, Maya, Southern Illinois University Press, 1995. One commentator has suggested that Wright's designs for the Yahara Boat Club of 1902 in Madison, Wisconsin, and the River Forest Tennis Club of 1906 in River Forest, Illinois, also served as design precedents for the Robie House. &quot;The Robie House of Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; Connors, Joseph, University of Chicago Press, 1984, pp. 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that he commissioned Wright to design his home, Robie was only 28 years old and the assistant manager of the Excelsior Supply Company, a company on the South Side of Chicago owned and managed by his father. Although later drawings of the Robie House show a date of 1906, Wright could not have started the design for the building earlier than the spring of 1908 because Robie had actually purchased the property only in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Id., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife, Lora Hieronymus Robie, a 1900 graduate of the University of Chicago, had selected the property at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue in order to remain close to the campus and the social life of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Id., pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The property was a typical urban lot in Hyde Park, measuring {{convert|60|ft|m}} by {{convert|180|ft|m}}.

The contractor for the project, H.B. Barnard Co. of Chicago, began construction on April 15, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Id., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright did not supervise the construction of the house except in the earliest stages. He closed his Oak Park studio in the fall of 1909 and left for Europe to undertake the work which led to the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]]. He turned over his existing commissions to [[Hermann V. von Holst|Hermann von Holst]], who retained [[Marion Lucy Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], a draughtswoman in Wright's office, and George Mann Niedecken, an interior designer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who had worked with Wright on the [[Dana-Thomas House|Susan Lawrence Dana House]] in Springfield, Illinois, the [[Coonley House|Avery Coonley House]] in Riverside, Illinois, and the [[Meyer May House]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to continue their work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Id., pp. 32-33. For an in depth description of the working relationship between Wright and Niedecken in connection with the Robie House, see &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright and George Mann Niedecken: Prairie School Collaborators,&quot; Robertson, Cheryl, Milwaukee Art Museum and the Museum of Our National Heritage, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Niedecken's influence can be seen in the design of some of the furnishings for the house as well as the carpets in the entrance hall, the living room, and the dining room.

The Robie family—Frederick, Laura, and their two children, Frederick Jr. and Lorraine—moved into the home in May 1910, although all of the final details, including rugs and furniture, were not completed until January 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Id., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The final cost of the home was $58,500--$13,500 for the land, $35,000 for the design and construction of the building, and $10,000 for the furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;Id., pp. 6, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; (Simple inflation adjusted equivalents of $58,500 in 1910 hover around $1.5 million in 2015, although other ways of comparing price and value over time could place that figure as high as $10 million without accounting for any potential premium as a result of the historical fame of the house.)&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ The Inflation Calculator].  Retrieved August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php/ Measuring Worth.com].  Retrieved August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Robie's original budget had been $60,000.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robie's tenure in his home was short lived, however. As a result of financial problems incurred by the death of his father in July 1908 and the deterioration of his marriage, Robie was forced to sell the house after living in it for only fourteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Id., p. 89. See also [http://www.antiquemotorcycle.org/TheMag/features/200802/flr_excelsior.html Frank Lloyd Wright and the Excelsior].&lt;/ref&gt; David Lee Taylor, president of Taylor-Critchfield Company, an advertising agency, bought the house and all of its Wright-designed contents in December 1911. Taylor died less than a year later, and his widow, Ellen Taylor, sold the house and most of its contents to Marshall D. Wilber, treasurer of the Wilber Mercantile Agency, in November 1912. The Wilbers were the last family to live in Robie House, living there for fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Id. pp. 89-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1926, the Wilbers sold the house and its contents to the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]], who used the house as a dormitory and dining hall although it was primarily interested in the site for purposes of future expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Id., p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology accidentally discovered that the Seminary was moving ahead with a plan to demolish the Robie House and informed his instructors, including [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;Smith, &quot;How the Robie House was Saved,&quot; Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly, pp. 4-19, vol. 19, no. 4 (Fall, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of demolition aroused a storm of protest. Although the Seminary's plans were subsequently postponed, the crisis was averted more by the onset of World War II than by acquiescence of the property’s owner.

The most serious threat to the existence of the Robie House arose 16 years later. On March 1, 1957, the Seminary announced plans to demolish the Robie House on September 15 in order to begin the construction of a dormitory for its students.&lt;ref&gt;Id. See also &quot;The Frederick C. Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,&quot; The Prairie School Review, pp. 10-19, vol. IV, no. 4 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This time an international outcry arose, and Wright himself, then 90 years old, returned to the Robie House on March 18, accompanied by the media, students and neighborhood organizers to protest the intended demolition of the house. Commenting on the threatened demolition, Wright quipped, &quot;It all goes to show the danger of entrusting anything spiritual to the clergy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 94. See &quot;Many Masks,&quot; Gill, Brendan, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1987, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, only weeks earlier, the Chicago City Council, led by Hyde Park alderman [[Leon Despres]], had enacted an ordinance to create the [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]]. On September 15, 1971, the newly formed Commission, with the support of Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], declared the Robie House a Chicago landmark. Moreover, two fraternities at the University of Chicago provided the Seminary with a realistic alternative to its plans of demolition. During his very brief tenure as a student at the University of Wisconsin, Wright had been a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. The University of Chicago's Phi Delt chapter house was located two doors north of the Robie house at 5737 Woodlawn Avenue, and the Seminary was already the owner of the lot between the two properties. The Phi Delts offered to vacate their house, and the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] fraternity, located next to the Phi Delt house, offered to vacate their house as well. These offers were a turning point in the effort to save the Robie house since the three properties provided the Seminary with sufficient land for the dormitory they sought to build.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 14-15. Bob Miller, President Emeritus and now Historian of Phi Delta Theta confirmed that the chapter moved a block away to 5625 University Avenue in 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1958, [[William Zeckendorf]], a friend of Wright's and a New York real estate developer then involved in several development projects on Chicago's south side, acquired the Robie House at Wright's urging from the seminary through his development company Webb &amp; Knapp.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot; /&gt; In February 1963, Zeckendorf donated the building to the University of Chicago. The University used Robie House as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, and later the building served as the headquarters for the University's Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 94. Prior to its use as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, the Robie House was partially restored between 1965 and 1967 under the direction of [[Walter Netsch]] of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]. &quot;The Frederick C. Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,&quot; The Prairie School Review, pp. 10-19, vol. IV, no. 4 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1997 the University moved their offices out and turned over tours, operations, fundraising and restoration to the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust on February 1.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Conserving a Masterpiece: The Frederick C. Robie House,&quot; Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly, pp. 12-17, vol. 17, no. 2 (Spring, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust is restoring the Robie House to its original appearance in 1910 when construction was completed and the house best reflected the design intent of the architect and the client. Major structural restoration has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://gowright.org/robie/&lt;/ref&gt; Harboe Architects, a leading firm in historic preservation, is currently conducting an assessment of Robie House and preparing schematic plans for completion of the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wright Angles: A Dialogue (Vol. 38, Issue 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust is following guidelines developed by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://gowright.org/restoration-project.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[Image:Robie House exterior HABS ILL,16-CHIG,33-1.jpg|thumb|Exterior (1911)]]
The Robie House is one of the best known examples of Frank Lloyd Wright's [[Prairie School|Prairie style]] of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately, the actual design drawings for the Robie House no longer exist although it is not known whether Wright discarded the drawings or they were destroyed in the Taliesin fire of 1914. The only construction documents that exist are the contractor's blueprints, several measured studies for furniture and interior details, and a couple of perspective renderings. &quot;The Robie House of Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; Connors, Joseph, University of Chicago Press, 1984, p. 46. The original blueprints, a survey of the Robie House lot, a set of the original specifications, the contractor's account book, and copies of 30 photographs of the house during construction are in the collection of the Department of Special Collections of the University of Chicago, donated in 1978 by William Bernard, the son of the original contractor, Harrison B. Bernard. Id., p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by architectural critics and historians (not by Wright) who noticed how the buildings and their various components owed their design influence to the landscape and plant life of the midwest prairie of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., &quot;The Meaning of Architecture,&quot; Pond, Irving K., Boston, 1918, p. 174 (stating that &quot;[i]n imitation of a certain broad and horizontal disposition of lines individually employed, a school of design has sprung up, for which its authors claim the title 'American.' The horizontal lines of the new expression appeal to the disciples of this school as echoing the spirit of the prairies of the great Middle West, which to them embodies the essence of democracy.&quot;) Although Wright used the term &quot;Prairie School&quot; in writings as early as 1936 (see ''Architect's Journal,'' London, 1936, reprinted in ''The Natural House,'' New York, 1954, p. 27), he referred to his work and that of other similarly inspired architects at the time as &quot;The New School of the Middle West&quot; in his noted article &quot;In the Cause of Architecture,&quot; ''The Architectural Record,'' March 1908.  Wright believed that the American Mid-West, rather than the East Coast, was the appropriate breeding ground for an indigenous American architecture because residents of the East Coast were too suspectible to the influences of the Old World styles of Europe. Instead, &lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he real American spirit, capable of judging an issue for itself upon its merits, lies in the West and Middle West, where breadth of view, independent thought, and a tendency to take common sense into the realm of art, as in life, are more characteristic. ... The people themselves are part and parcel and helpful in producing the organic thing. They can comprehend it and make it theirs, and it is thus the only form art expression to be considered for a democracy, and I will go so far as to say, the truest of all forms.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &quot;Ausgeführte Bauten und Entwürfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910.  For a discussion of Wright's conception of the New School of the Middle West, see generally &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,&quot; Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, pp. 106-109, 145-148, 158-163. For a discussion of the development and use of the term &quot;Prairie School,&quot; see &quot;The Prairie School: Frank Lloyd Wright and His Midwest Contemporaries,&quot; Brooks, H. Allen, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., New York, 1972, pp. 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of Wright's Prairie houses, he designed not only the house, but all of the interiors, the windows, lighting, rugs, furniture and textiles. As Wright wrote in 1910, &quot;it is quite impossible to consider the building one thing and its furnishings another.  ...  They are all mere structural details of its character and completeness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910, quoted in &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright's Dana House,&quot; Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exterior===
The projecting [[cantilever]]ed roof eaves, continuous bands of art-glass windows, and the use of [[Roman brick]] emphasize the horizontal, which had rich associations for Wright. The horizontal line reminded him of the American prairie and was a line of repose and shelter, appropriate for a house.
The exterior walls are double-[[wythe]] construction of a Chicago common brick core with a red-orange iron-spotted Roman brick veneer. To further emphasize the horizontal of the bricks, the horizontal joints were filled with a cream-colored mortar and the small vertical joints were filled with brick-colored mortar. From a distance, this complex and expensive [[tuckpointing]] creates an impression of continuous lines of horizontal color and minimizes the appearance of individual bricks.
The design of the art glass windows is an abstract pattern of colored and clear glass using Wright's favorite 30 and 60-degree angles. Wright used similar designs in tapestries inside the house and for gates surrounding the outdoor spaces and enclosing the garage courtyard.
Robie's generous budget allowed Wright to design a house with a largely steel structure, which accounts for the minimal deflection of the eaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman Robie House&quot;&gt;&quot;Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,&quot; Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
The planter urns, copings, lintels, sills and other exterior trimwork are of [[Indiana Limestone|Bedford limestone]].

===Interior===
In plan, the house is designed as two large rectangles that seem to slide by one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/PDFs/200493.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory—Nomination Form, Frederick C. Robie House], p. 16-18. Retrieved October 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Wright referred to the rectangle on the southwest portion of the site, which contains the principal living spaces of the house, as &quot;the major vessel.&quot; On the first floor are the &quot;billiards&quot; room (west end) and children's playroom (east end). The billiards room provided access to a large walk-in safe and a storage area built underneath the front porch projection at the west end of the site. The billiards and playroom open into a small passage and doors near the center of the building to an enclosed garden on the south side of the building. Another door from the playroom opens into the courtyard on the east end of the site. On the second floor are the entry hall at the top of the central stairway, the living room (west end) and the dining room (east end). Built-in inglenook bench cabinetry originally separated the entry hallway from the living room. The living and dining rooms flow into one another along the south side of the building and open through a series of twelve French doors containing art glass panels to an exterior balcony running the length of the south side of the building that overlooks the enclosed garden. The west end of the living room contains a “prow” with art glass windows and two art glass doors that open onto the west porch beneath the cantilevered roof. Wright intended that the users of the building move freely from the interior space to the exterior space.

The rectangle on the northeast portion of the site, called &quot;the minor vessel,&quot; contains the more functional and service-related rooms of the house. On the first floor is the main door and entrance hall (west end) from which a stairway leads to the second floor living and dining rooms. A half bath is located on the north side of the entrance hall. Further east are a coat closet and back stairway, the boiler room, laundry room, and coal storage room, followed by a small workshop, half bath, and a three-car garage. The westernmost bay of the garage originally contained a mechanic’s pit, and the eastern most bay contained equipment to wash and clean automobiles. On the second floor of the minor vessel is a guest bedroom above the entrance hall and an adjoining full bath. East of the back stairway are the kitchen and butler’s pantry, and the servants’ sitting room. Two bedrooms and a full bathroom above the garage complete the quarters for the live-in servants.

The third floor overlaps the major and minor vessels in the center of the building. Wright referred to the third floor as the “belvedere,” the “place in command of beautiful views.” The south side of the third floor contains the master bedroom, dressing area, a full bathroom, and, through a small closet and an art glass door, a balcony facing south and west. Two additional bedrooms and a full bathroom are located on the north side of this floor. All of the windows on this level contain art glass panels. Dresser drawers are built-in to the walls of the bedrooms underneath the windows, and project into the eave spaces.

The entire building is approximately {{convert|9062|sqft|m2}}.

The chimney mass containing four fireplaces—one in the billiards room, playroom, living room and master bedroom—and the main stairway from the entrance hall to the second floor living and dining rooms rise through the center of the house, from which the rest of the building radiates. The chimney mass is constructed of the same brick and limestone as the exterior.

The front door and main entrance is partially hidden on the northwest side of the building beneath an overhanging balcony in order to create a sense of privacy and protection for the family. The entrance hall itself is low-ceilinged and dark, but the stairs to the second floor create a sense of anticipation as the visitor moves upward. Once upstairs, the light filled living and dining rooms create a sharp contrast to the dark entrance hall making the living and dining rooms seem even more special. These two rooms are separated by the central chimney mass, but the spaces are connected along their south sides, and the chimney mass has an opening above the fireplace through which the rooms are visually connected. These features unite the two spaces, creating an openness of plan which, for Wright, was a metaphor for the openness of American political and social life.

As with all Prairie houses, Wright designed the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces can be found in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor living and dining rooms, spherical globes within wooden squares are integrated into the ceiling trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the living and dining rooms, as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the living and dining rooms, are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.

The steel beams in the ceilings and floors carry most of the building's weight to piers at the east and west ends. As a result, the exterior walls have little structural function, and thus are filled with doors and windows containing art glass panels. The house contains 174 art glass window and door panels in 29 different designs. Although Wright occasionally designed art glass using stylized forms from nature, the designs of the Robie House art glass are possibly just abstract geometric forms. Another important reason for the glass was to make the interior seem bigger; he made it feel more spacy and airy by adding large and numerous windows and stained glass. The steel structure also eliminates the need for internal structural columns and walls, accenting the open plan Wright favored.

Wright also designed the furniture, carpets, and textiles for most Prairie houses. However, Wright-designed furniture in the Robie House was only constructed for the entrance hall, the living and dining rooms, guest bedroom, and one bed for the third-floor bedrooms. Some of these pieces are attributed to Wright's interior design collaborator George Mann Niedecken. Robie’s financial situation following his father’s death may be the explanation for why the entire house was not furnished with furniture of Wright’s designs. Most of the original furniture is currently in the collection of the [[Smart Museum of Art]] at the University of Chicago, although only the dining room table and chairs are on more or less permanent display.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/smart/smart.pl?maker=wright&amp;title=&amp;accession=&amp;materials=&amp;curatorclass=&amp;curatortype=&amp;registrartype= Smart Museum of Art On-Line Database Project].

===Architectural significance===
[[Image:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Interior window detail (1963)]]

The Robie House was one of the last houses Wright designed in his [[Oak Park, Illinois]] home and studio and also one of the last of his Prairie School houses.&lt;ref name=habs&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/habs_haer/placeI.html Illinois Places], Frederick C. Robie House, Data Pages, Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of Congress. Retrieved January 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Historical American Buildings Survey, the city of Chicago's Commission on Chicago Architectural Landmarks stated: &quot;The bold interplay of horizontal planes about the chimney mass, and the structurally expressive piers and windows, established a new form of domestic design.&quot;&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; Because the house's components are so well designed and coordinated, it is considered to be a quintessential example of Wright's Prairie School architecture and the &quot;measuring stick&quot; against which all other Prairie School buildings are compared.

The house and the Robie name were immortalized in Ernst Wasmuth's famous 1910 publication ''Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe von Frank Lloyd Wright'' (''Completed Buildings and Projects of Frank Lloyd Wright'', a.k.a. &quot;The Wasmuth Portfolio&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910. An on-line copy of the [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=/FLWright-jp2 Wasmuth Portfolio], including Plate XXXVII of [http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/FLWright-jp2&amp;CISOPTR=134&amp;REC=15 Volume 2] containing a rendering of the Robie House and third floor plans, as well as an overlay of the first and second floor plans, is available through the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication featured most of Wright's designs, including those unbuilt, during his Oak Park years and brought them to the attention of students of the [[Bauhaus]] school in Germany and the [[De Stijl]] school in the Netherlands. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] among other great 20th Century architects, claimed Wright was a major influence on their careers. Mies van der Rohe later visited the Robie House and Wright's home ([[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]) in Spring Green, WI.

The architectural significance of the Robie House was probably best stated in a 1957 article in ''House and Home'' magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the decades of eclecticism's triumph there were also many innovators--less heralded than the fashionable practitioners, but exerting more lasting influence. Of these innovators, none could rival Frank Lloyd Wright. By any standard his Robie house was the House of the 1900s--indeed the House of the Century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Above all else, the Robie House is a magnificent work of art. But, in addition, the house introduced so many concepts in planning and construction that its full influence cannot be measured accurately for many years to come. Without this house, much of modern architecture as we know it today, might not exist.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One Hundred Years of the American House,&quot; ''House and Home,'' May 1957, pp. 110 and 116, quoted in &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright: Master Builder,&quot; Pfeiffer, Bruce Brooks, Thames &amp; Hudson, 1997, p. 72. Another commentator described the architectural significance of the Robie House as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wright's [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] of 1893 was already a synthesis of the practical with the beautiful in home building. By 1908 he was able to bring about, in the Robie House on the campus of the University of Chicago, what is for many Americans the finest work of art turned out by any of our architects in our history as a nation. In this house Wright blends the sonorous long lines of the machinelike form with a rich decorative effect that is ages old. Both the old and the new come together in this adult prairie house. Here for the first time since the days of our great colonial builders--Bulfinch, Jefferson, and McIntire--a man creates a home for Americans that can stand the test of international comparison. When his work was published in a sumptuous monograph in Berlin, Germany, in 1910, it was the design of the Robie House that caught everyone's eye. European builders had been enmeshed in their dependence on historical forms. Wright and the Robie House of 1908 showed them the way to the fundamental patterns of modern architectural expression. So much so, in fact, that even the extremes of cubistic modern architecture, the &quot;cigar-box covered with cold-cream&quot; style may be traced back to the influence of Wright's Robie House.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kienitz, John Fabian, &quot;Fifty-Two Years of Frank Lloyd Wright's Progressivism,&quot; ''The Wisconsin Magazine of History,'' Vol. 29, No. 1 (Sept. 1945), p.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1956, ''The Archectural Record'' selected the Robie House as &quot;one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,&quot; Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the American Institute of Architects named Robie House among the Top All-Time Work of American Architects.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0413/0413n_polls.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[United States Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]] submitted the Robie house, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage Status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/oia/topics/worldheritage/New_Tentative_List.htm DOI Secretary Kempthorne Selects New U.S. World Heritage Tentative List, National Park Service].

Retrieved August 7, 2012. The list of buildings included those on the tentative list as well as the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House|Herbert and Katherine Jacobs House]] (1936), Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The final decision on inclusion on the list will be made by the World Heritage Committee, composed of representatives from 21 nations and advised by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. The U.S. nominations will likely be formally nominated to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in 2013, for possible inclusion on the World Heritage List in 2014.

In 2011, [[Lego]] released a model set of the Robie House under its [[Lego Architecture]] line of products; it was the third Wright building featured in the series.&lt;ref name=LegoVers&gt;[http://architecture.lego.com/en-us/products/architect/robie-house/ Robie House], LEGO, accessed May 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robie House is the subject of a 2013 PBS documentary and companion book, “10 Buildings that Changed America.” &lt;ref&gt;http://interactive.wttw.com/tenbuildings&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighborhood context===

At the time Robie House was commissioned in 1908, the lots surrounding the house's site were mostly vacant except for the lots immediately to the north on Woodlawn Avenue, which were filled with large homes. To the east of the site and across a municipal service alley, a French Provincial style house for Nobel prize winning physicist [[Albert A. Michelson]] was built around 1923. The lots to the south were vacant and afforded uninterrupted views to the [[Midway Plaisance]] parkland, one of the sites of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. To the west, a full block of vacant land separated the site from the growing University of Chicago campus, but by 1930 [[Rockefeller Chapel]] (1928), the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] (1928), and the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] (1930) buildings had been constructed.

Directly south across 58th Street from Robie House is the Charles M. Harper Center of the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]. Designed by the Uruguayan-born architect [[Rafael Viñoly]] and completed in 2004, the building both respects the scale of the Robie House and contains elements that echo Wright's contributions to the vocabulary of modern architecture. “The massing was considered with that of the surrounding buildings of the campus and the neighborhood,” Viñoly said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0410/features/gothic.shtml &quot;Prairie Gothic,&quot; ''The University of Chicago Magazine'', vol. 97, no. 1, October 2004]. See also “Viñoly,” Viñoly, Raphael, Princeton Architectural Press, 2002; “University of Chicago,” Pridmore, Jay, and Kiar, Peter, Princeton Architectural Press, 2006, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Viñoly selected the linear limestone and cantilevered floors with the Robie House in mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040923/gsb.shtml Jessamine Chan and Allan Friedman, “University’s GSB Center Opens for Business Today,” ''The University of Chicago Chronicle'', vol. 24 no. 1, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, built-in planters edge the second floor balconies and surround the entranceway terrace, echoing those found on the Robie House balconies and porches. The entranceway terrace itself provides visitors with a panoramic view of the south elevation of the Robie House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomaroon.com/2005/5/10/new-gsbs-architect-vinoly-speaks-downtown Hassan S. Ali, “New GSB’s Architect Viñoly Speaks Downtown,” ''Chicago Maroon'', May 10, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Viñoly acknowledged that these elements of his design were intended to pay homage to Wright and his architectural vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagogsb.edu/magazine/sum_fall04/vinoly.pdf Anthony Ruth, “A Sense of Unified Purpose,” ''Chicago GSB'', Summer/Fall 2004, pp. 22-23].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Blue Balliett]]'s children's book, ''[[The Wright 3]]'', the plot centers around mysteries associated with Robie House.

== CPOST and GTD ==

Pape et al. reported major differences in the numbers of suicide terrorist incidents by year between CPOST and the [[Global Terrorism Database]] (GTD).  For 2008 and 2013 they reported the following:&lt;ref name='Pape14'&gt;{{Citation

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Pape's comparison of GTD and CPOST&lt;ref&gt;If the numbers in 2007 and 2013 are independent [[Poisson distribution|Poisson counts]], then the GTD results show an increase of 8.3 standard deviations, while CPOST reports a 3.2 standard deviation ''decrease'';  both are statistically significant by virtually all commonly used criteria.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Pape et al. quote GTD officials as claiming that their “researchers, past and present, have ensured that the entire database uses the same standards for inclusion and is as comprehensive as possible.”  Pape et al. disagree, noting that the difference between the GTD and CPOST counts is easily explained by a change in GTD methodology that occurred 11/1/2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

They conclude, “American policy makers and the public deserve the best data available on terrorism, one of the most important national security issues of our time.”&lt;ref name='Pape14'/&gt;

In 2003, the [[Toyota Technological Institute]] of [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]] opened the '''Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago''' (TTIC), jointly with the [[University of Chicago]]. The stated purpose of the institute is to impact research and education in [[computer science]].

The Institute is philanthropically endowed, dedicated to basic research and graduate education in computer science. Its mission is to achieve international impact through world-class research and education in fundamental computer science and information technology. The Institute is distinctive to the American educational scene in its unique combination of graduate education and endowed research.

It has degree-granting authority in the State of Illinois and has been awarded accreditation from [[The Higher Learning Commission]] of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]].

TTIC offers a graduate program leading to a doctorate in computer science, and is currently focusing primarily on [[theoretical computer science]] (algorithms and complexity), [[machine learning]] (and related [[Applications of artificial intelligence|AI applications]]), [[programming language]]s (and related areas such as [[formal verification]] and security) and [[Computational science|scientific computing]] (including [[numerical analysis]], [[Mathematical optimization|numerical optimization]], and [[signal processing]]).

The faculty and students of TTIC often collaborate with the computer science department of the University of Chicago. Moreover, classes in computer science are taught by members from both faculties, and students from TTIC and the University of Chicago have access to the same set of CS classes and university resources.

TTIC is located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the University of Chicago campus.

The '''Marine Biological Laboratory''' ('''MBL''') is an international center for research and education in biology, biomedicine, and environmental science. Founded in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. After being independent for most of its history, it became affiliated with the university in 2013.  It also collaborates with other institutions, including [[Brown University]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], and the [[Woods Hole Research Center]].

== Introduction ==
The MBL has approximately 300 year-round employees, about half of which are scientists and scientific support staff. They are joined each year by more than 300 visiting scientists, summer staff, and research associates from hundreds of institutions around the world, who conduct research in the Whitman Center for Visiting Research (MBL Facts).

During the summer, more than 1,400 students and faculty from around the world come to the MBL to participate in the laboratory's graduate-level courses, including Neurobiology, Microbial Diversity, Frontiers in Reproduction, and Biology of Parasitism. Some of these courses (Physiology, Embryology, and Neural Systems and Behavior, formerly called Invertebrate Zoology) have been offered for more than a century (MBL Facts).

The MBL's three main resident research centers are The Ecosystems Center, The Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution, and the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering (MBL Facts).

The MBL and [[Brown University]] share a research and educational affiliation. However, the Brown-MBL Partnership, which included a Ph.D.-awarding Graduate Program in Biological and Environmental Sciences, has ended. Other MBL programs train postgraduates, undergraduates, science teachers, historians, and science journalists. Throughout the year, the MBL is the site for research and planning conferences organized by professional scientific groups (MBL Facts).

The MBL shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences, and houses a growing archival collection, including photograph and videos from the MBL's 120-year history. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects (MBL Facts).

MBL's president and director is genetics and genomics researcher and professor [[Huntington Willard]].&lt;ref&gt; http://www.capenews.net/falmouth/news/new-president-and-director-at-mbl/article_e38e0052-8476-11e4-a4b7-73f72c700f17.html&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded cell biologist [[Joan V. Ruderman]] in 2015 (MBL Facts).

== History ==
The Marine Biological Laboratory grew from the vision of several Bostonians and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the country's first Fish Commissioner. Baird had set up a [[United States Fish Commission]] research station in Woods Hole in 1882, and had ambitions to expand it into a major laboratory. He invited [[Alpheus Hyatt]] to move his marine biology laboratory and school which he had founded at the [[Norwood-Hyatt House]] in [[Annisquam, Massachusetts]] to Woods Hole. Inspired by Harvard biologist [[Louis Agassiz]]'s short-lived summer school of natural history on Penikese Island, off the coast of Woods Hole, Hyatt accepted the offer. With $10,000 raised by the Woman's Education Association of Boston and the [[Boston Society of Natural History]], land was purchased, a building was erected, and the MBL was incorporated with Hyatt as the first president of the board of trustees. The Fish Commission supplied crucial support, including marine organisms and running sea water (Maienschein, 1989).

[[Charles Otis Whitman]], an embryologist, was retained as the first director of the MBL. Whitman, who believed “other things being equal, the investigator is always the best instructor,” emphasized the need to combine research and education at the new laboratory. The MBL's first summer course provided a six-week introduction to invertebrate zoology; facilities for visiting summer investigators were also offered (Marine Biological Laboratory, 1888).

The MBL Library was established in 1889, with scientist and future MBL trustee [[Cornelia Clapp]] serving as librarian. In 1899, the MBL began publishing ''[[The Biological Bulletin]]'', a scientific journal that is still edited at the MBL (Maienschein, 1989).

The MBL formally affiliated with the University of Chicago on July 1, 2013. In order to further scientific research and education, the affiliation builds on historical ties with the university, as MBL was led by University of Chicago faculty members in its first four decades (MBL Facts).  The president of the university chairs the MBL trustee's board and with their advice appoints its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/2013/11/27/university-of-chicago-president-robert-j-zimmer-to-serve-as-chairman-of-marine-biological-laboratory-board-of-trustees-2/|title=University of Chicago President Robert J. Zimmer to serve as Chairman of Marine Biological Laboratory Board of Trustees|work=Affiliation with University of Chicago|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laboratory is a non-profit Massachusetts corporation, whose sole member is the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.edu/directorsearch/files/2014/07/MBL-Director-Position-Profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
=== Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology ===
Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology have been a central part of the MBL's programs since the 1890s. Important discoveries in these fields at the MBL reach back to 1899, when [[Jacques Loeb]] demonstrated artificial parthenogenesis in sea urchin eggs; to 1905, when [[Edwin Grant Conklin]] first identified egg cytoplasmic regions that are programmed to form certain tissues or organs; to 1916, when [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] identified circulating hormones that influence sexual differentiation (Lillie, 1944). In the MBL's first two decades, cytologists [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Nettie Stevens]] and others made connections between the chromosomes and Mendelian heredity, while Wilson's colleague at both the MBL and Columbia University, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], launched the field of experimental genetics (Pauly, 2000:158). [[Keith R. Porter]], considered by many to be a founder of modern cell biology due to his pioneering work on the fine structure of cells, including the discovery of [[microtubules]], carried out research at the MBL starting in 1937 and directed the laboratory from 1975-77 (Barlow et al., 1993: 95-115).

The MBL has long been a center for the world's experts in cell division. Resident Distinguished Scientist Shinya Inoué's innovations in polarized light microscopy and video imaging since the 1950s have been instrumental in clarifying the cellular events of [[mitosis]], including his discovery of the [[spindle fibers]]. In the early 1980s, [[Tim Hunt]], Joan Ruderman and others at the MBL identified the first of a class of proteins that regulate the cycle of cell division ([[cyclin]]). Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001 for this work (Hunt, 2004). In 1984, [[Ron Vale]], Michael Sheetz, and others discovered [[kinesin]], a motor protein involved in mitosis and other cellular processes, during summer MBL research. Vale, Sheetz, and James Spudich received the 2012 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their discoveries related to molecular motors. In 1991 Israeli scientist [[Avram Hershko]] began coming to the MBL to study the role that the protein ubiquitin plays in cell division. In 2004, Hershko won a Nobel Prize for his work to establish the basic mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

The MBL is also a proving ground for new technologies in [[microscopy]] and imaging. The availability of cutting-edge imaging instrumentation in the MBL's discovery-based courses puts faculty and students at the forefront of experimentation. MBL Distinguished Scientist [[Osamu Shimomura]], who joined the MBL in 1983, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) in the early 1960s, which led to the development of revolutionary techniques for imaging live cells and their components. 

A large portion of the leading developmental biologists in the United States, both historically and today, have participated in the MBL's Embryology Course as directors, lecturers or students. One draw is the Woods Hole location and the availability of marine organisms, particularly the [[sea urchin]], that are ideal for embryological analysis because they shed nearly transparent eggs which are fertilized and develop externally. In the first decades after the course was founded in 1893, its faculty pioneered research directions that remain central today, including the study of cytoplasmic localization in eggs; embryonic cell lineage (important in modern [[stem cell]] research); and [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (today called ‘evo devo'). Some distinguished embryologists who have directed the course are [[Charles Otis Whitman]] (1893–1895); [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] (1896–1903); Viktor Hamburger (1942–45); James Ebert (1962–66); [[Eric H. Davidson]] (1972–74; 1988–96); and Rudolf Raff (1980–82) (see Davidson, 1993). The course continues to be a premier training ground for developmental biologists and is currently co-directed by Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and Richard Behringer (2012-2016).

=== Regenerative biology and medicine ===
In 2010, the MBL established the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, where researchers study the ability of marine and other animals to spontaneously regenerate damaged or aging body parts. An understanding of tissue and organ regeneration in lower animals holds promise for translation to treatments for human conditions, including spinal cord injury, diabetes, organ failure, and degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer's.  A cornerstone of the Bell Center is a national resource for research on the frog, Xenopus, which is a major animal model used in U.S. biomedical research. The National Xenopus Resource at the MBL is funded by the National Institutes of Health (MBL Facts).

=== Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology ===
The MBL's contributions to [[neuroscience]] and sensory physiology are significant, fostered today by more than 65 visiting investigators and resident researchers in these fields, as well as nine graduate- and post-graduate level courses. The MBL has been a magnet for the discipline since L.W. Williams in 1910 discovered, and [[John Zachary Young]] in 1936 rediscovered, the [[squid giant axon]], a nerve fiber that is 20 times larger in diameter than the largest human axon. Young brought this locally abundant, ideal experimental system to the attention of his MBL colleague [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|KS Cole]], who in 1938 used it to record the resistance changes underlying the action potential, which provided evidence that ions flowing across the axonal membrane generate this electrical impulse. In 1938, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] came to the MBL to learn about the squid giant axon from Cole. After World War II, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]], working in Plymouth, England and using the [[voltage clamp]] technique developed by Cole, laid the basis for the modern understanding of electrical activity in the nervous system by measuring quantitatively the flow of ions across the axonal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley received the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction (Barlow et al., 1993: 151-172). Following on Hodgkin and Huxley's work, in the 1960s and 1970s [[Clay Armstrong]] and other MBL researchers described a number of the properties of the [[ion channels]] that allow sodium and potassium ions to carry electric current across the cell membrane and [[Rodolfo Llinas]] described the transmission properties at the squid giant synapse (Llinas 1999). The “scientific career” of the “Woods Hole squid,” ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii|Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii]]'', continues today, with studies on [[axonal transport]], the [[squid giant synapse]], squid genomics, and the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

Other marine organisms draw neuroscientists and neurobiologists to the MBL each summer, where a history of research into sensory physiology and behavior has been established. [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]], an MBL summer investigator in the 1920s and early 1930s, uncovered several basic mechanisms of photoreceptor function through his studies on the horseshoe crab. Hartline shared the 1967 Nobel Prize with summer MBL colleague [[George Wald]], who described the molecular basis of photoreception by showing that the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules consist of a slightly modified form of vitamin A coupled to a protein.  Another long-term summer investigator, [[Stephen W. Kuffler]], is credited with “founding” the science of [[neurobiology]] in the mid-1960s at Harvard Medical School and he also initiated instruction in neurobiology at the MBL (Barlow et al., 1993:175-234; 203-234). [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] (Nobel Laureate in 1937) conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986, most significantly on the biochemical nature of muscular contraction.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Frederik Bang and Jack Levin at the MBL discovered that the blood of the horseshoe crab clotted when exposed to bacterial endotoxins even in vanishingly small amounts. From this basic research, a reagent, Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), was developed that can detect minute amounts of bacterial toxins. The [[LAL test]] has resulted in dramatic improvement in the quality of drugs and biological products for intravenous injection.

=== Ecosystems science ===
Ecosystems research became a year-round commitment at the MBL in 1962 with the founding of the Systematics-Ecology program, under the direction of Melbourne R. Carriker. In 1975, the MBL's Ecosystems Center was established, with George Woodwell as director. The original research focus was on the global [[carbon cycle]], an emphasis maintained today. The Ecosystems Center has a year-round staff of more than 40 scientists who study a variety of ecosystems and their responses to human activities and environmental changes. The center is located in Woods Hole yet has a global reach, with active research sites in the Arctic tundra; in forest, coastal and marine sites in New England, Sweden and Brazil; and on the Antarctic Peninsula. The Ecosystems Center is home to two of the 26 U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Toolik Lake, Alaska; and Plum Island, Massachusetts. Scientists in the Ecosystems Center study the effects of forest clearance and land-use change on atmospheric chemistry, watershed processes and coastal ecology, the global-scale anthropogenic enrichment of the [[nitrogen cycle]], and ecosystem responses to [[global warming]]. The Ecosystems Center is directed by Christopher Neill, whose studies the impact of land-use changes on ecosystems. The Center's immediate past director is Hugh Ducklow, a biological oceanographer. Former directors of the Center who are still active on the scientific staff are Jerry Melillo, who studies the [[biogeochemistry]] of terrestrial ecosystems, and John Hobbie, a microbial ecologist. The Ecosystems Center is founded on a vision of collaborative, interdisciplinary science; shared lab facilities and instrumentation; and a long-term, large-scale, systems-wide view of ecosystem processes.

=== Comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and microbial ecology ===
The Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded at the MBL in 1997 and is currently directed by David Mark Welch. By comparing diverse [[genomes]], scientists at the center are elucidating the evolutionary relationships of biological systems, and describing genes and genomes of biomedical and environmental significance. [[Microorganisms]] found in a wide range of ecosystems, including the human [[microbiome]], are studied. Mitchell Sogin, the Bay Paul Center's founder, also founded two courses at the MBL: the Workshop in Molecular Evolution; and Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures. In 2003-2004, Sogin launched the International Census of Marine Microbes, a global effort to describe the [[biodiversity]] of marine micro-organisms. Early results from this census in 2006 revealed some 10 to 100 times more types of marine microbes than expected, and the vast majority are previously unknown, low-abundance microorganisms now called the “rare biosphere.” Other Bay Paul Center projects are focused on microbes that live in extreme environments, from [[hydrothermal vents]] to highly acidic ecosystems, which may lead to a better understanding of life that could exist on other planets. Activities at the Bay Paul Center are supported by advanced DNA sequencing and other genomics equipment at the center's Keck Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Facility.

The '''University of Chicago Press''' is the largest and one of the oldest [[university press]]es in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29487771_ITM|title=The University of Chicago Press Selects Rightslink(R) For Online Copyright Permissions|date=February 5, 2007|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by the [[University of Chicago]] and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', numerous academic journals, and a wide array of advanced monographs in the academic fields.

One of its quasi-independent projects is the [[BiblioVault]], a digital repository for scholarly books.

The Press building is located just south of the [[Midway Plaisance]] on the University of Chicago campus.

==History==
[[File:University of Chicago, Harper Library.jpg|thumb|University of Chicago, [[University of Chicago Library|Harper Library]]]]
The University of Chicago Press was founded in 1891, making it one of the oldest continuously operating university presses in the United States. Its first published book was Robert F. Harper's ''Assyrian and Babylonian Letters Belonging to the Kouyunjik Collections of the British Museum''. The book sold five copies during its first two years, but by 1900 the University of Chicago Press had published 127 books and pamphlets and 11 scholarly journals, including the current ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'', and  ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.

For its first three years, the Press was an entity discrete from the university; it was operated by the Boston publishing house [[D. C. Heath and Company|D. C. Heath]] in conjunction with the Chicago printer [[RR Donnelley|R. R. Donnelley]]. This arrangement proved unworkable, however, and in 1894 the university officially assumed responsibility for the Press.

In 1902, as part of the university, the Press started working on the ''Decennial Publications''. Composed of articles and monographs by scholars and administrators on the state of the university and its faculty's research, the ''Decennial Publications'' was a radical reorganization of the Press. This allowed the Press, by 1905, to begin publishing books by scholars not of the University of Chicago. A manuscript editing and proofreading department was added to the existing staff of printers and typesetters, leading, in 1906, to the first edition of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''.

By 1931, the Press was an established, leading academic publisher. Leading books of that era include [[Edgar J. Goodspeed|Dr. Edgar J. Goodspeed's]] ''The New Testament: An American Translation'' (the Press's first nationally successful title) and its successor, Goodspeed and J. M. Povis Smith's ''The Complete Bible: An American Translation''; [[William Craigie|Sir William Alexander Craigie's]] [[Dictionary of American English|''A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles'']], published in four volumes in 1943; John Manly and Edith Rickert's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', published in 1940; and  [[Kate Turabian|Kate Turabian's]] ''[[A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations]]''.

In 1956, the Press first published paperback-bound books under its imprint. Of the Press's best-known  books, most date from the 1950s, including translations of the ''Complete Greek Tragedies'' and [[Richmond Lattimore|Richmond Lattimore's]] [[Iliad|''The Iliad of Homer'']]. That decade also saw the first edition of ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature'', which has since been used by students of [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] worldwide.

In 1966, [[Morris Philipson]] began his thirty-four-year tenure as director of the University of Chicago Press. He committed time and resources to lengthening the backlist, becoming known for assuming ambitious scholarly projects, among the largest of which was ''[[Lisle Letters|The Lisle Letters]]'' — a vast collection of 16th-century correspondence by [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]], a wealth of information about every aspect of sixteenth-century life.

As the Press's scholarly volume expanded, the Press also advanced as a trade publisher. In 1992, [[Norman Maclean]]'s books ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' and ''[[Young Men and Fire]]'' were national best sellers, and ''A River Runs Through It'' was made into a [[A River Runs Through It (film)|film]] directed by and starring [[Robert Redford]].

In 1982, Philipson was the first director of an academic press to win the ''Publisher Citation'', one of [[International PEN|PEN's]] most prestigious awards. Shortly before he retired in June 2000, Philipson received the [[Association of American Publishers|Association of American Publishers']] ''Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing'', awarded to the person whose &quot;creativity and leadership have left a lasting mark on American publishing.&quot;

[[Paula Barker Duffy]] served as director of the Press from 2000 to 2007. Under her administration, the Press expanded its distribution operations and created the Chicago Digital Distribution Center and [[BiblioVault]]. Editorial depth in reference and regional books increased with titles such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Timothy J. Gilfoyle's ''Millennium Park'', and new editions of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the [[A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations|Turabian Manual]], and ''The University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary.'' The Press also launched an electronic reference work, The Chicago Manual of Style Online.

==Current status==
[[File:UChicagoPress.jpg|thumb|University of Chicago Press]]

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[Garrett P. Kiely]] became the 15th director of the University of Chicago Press on September 1, 2007. He heads one of academic publishing's largest operations, employing more than 300 people across three divisions—books, journals, and distribution—and publishing 72 journal titles and approximately 280 new books and 70 paperback reprints each year.

The Press publishes over 50 new trade titles per year, across many subject areas. It also publishes regional titles, such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'' (2004), edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice Reiff;&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3617598.html Grossman, Keating, and Reiff, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chicagoan: A Lost Magazine of the Jazz Age'' (2008) by Neil Harris; ''One More Time: The Best of Mike Royko'' (1999), a collection of columns by Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaperman [[Mike Royko]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''; and many other books about the art, architecture, and nature of [[Chicago]] and the [[Midwest]].

The Press has recently expanded its digital offerings to include most newly published books as well as key backlist titles. In 2013, Chicago Journals began offering e-book editions of each new issue of each journal, for use on e-reader devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[iPad]], and [[Amazon Kindle]]. The contents of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' are available online to paid subscribers. The Chicago Distribution Center is recognized as a leading distributor of scholarly works, with over 100 client presses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/press/about.html &quot;About the Press,&quot; ''University of Chicago Press'', accessed April 23, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books Division===
The Books Division of the University of Chicago Press has been publishing books for scholars, students, and general readers since 1892 and has published over 11,000 books since its founding. The Books Division presently{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} has more than 6,000 books in print, including such well-known works as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' (1906); ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), by [[Thomas Kuhn]]; ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1976), by [[Norman Maclean]]; and ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944), by [[Friedrich Hayek|F. A. Hayek]]. In July 2009, the Press announced the [[Chicago Digital Editions]] program, which made many of the Press's titles available in [[e-book]] form for sale to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ebooks/|title=New free e-book every month from the University of Chicago Press|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2016, more than 3,500 titles are available in this format. In August 2010, the Press published the 16th Edition of ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' simultaneously in print and online editions. The Books Division offers a Free E-book Of The Month program, through which site visitors may provide their e-mail address and receive a link to that month's free, downloadable e-book selection.

===Journals Division===
The Journals Division of the University of Chicago Press publishes and distributes influential scholarly publications on behalf of learned and professional societies and associations, foundations, museums, and other not-for-profit organizations. As of 2016 it publishes [[List of University of Chicago Press journals|72 titles]] in a wide range of academic disciplines including the biological and medical sciences, education, the humanities, the physical sciences, and the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; All are peer-reviewed journals of original scholarship, with readerships that include scholars, scientists, and medical practitioners as well as interested, educated laypeople. The Journals Division has been a pioneer in making scholarly and scientific journals available in electronic form in conjunction with their print editions. [[Electronic publishing]] efforts were launched in 1995; by 2004 all the journals published by the University of Chicago Press were available online. In 2013, all new journal issues were also made available to subscribers in [[e-book]] format.

===Chicago Distribution Center===
The Distribution Services Division provides the University of Chicago Press's customer service, warehousing, and related services. The Chicago Distribution Center (CDC) began providing distribution services in 1991, when the [[University of Tennessee Press]] became its first client. Currently{{when|date=January 2015}} the CDC serves nearly 100 publishers including [[Northwestern University Press]], [[Stanford University Press]], [[Temple University Press]], [[University of Iowa Press]], [[University of Minnesota Press]], and many others. Since 2001, with development funding from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the Chicago Digital Distribution Center (CDDC) has been offering digital printing services and the [[BiblioVault]] digital repository services to book publishers. In 2009, the CDC enabled the sales of electronic books directly to individuals and provided digital delivery services for the [[University of Michigan Press]] among others. The Chicago Distribution Center has also partnered with an additional 15 presses, including the [[University of Missouri Press]], [[West Virginia University Press]], and publications of the [[Getty Foundation]].

The '''Lorado Taft Midway Studios''' consist of a converted and relocated [[barn]] that became the art studio of [[Lorado Taft]], one of the early 20th century's most important [[sculptor]]s.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/T/TaftMidway.html|title=Lorado Taft's Midway Studios|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It sits in the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], and is owned by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=nhlsum/&gt;

In 1906, Taft moved his main studio from the [[Chicago Loop]] to a brick barn near the [[Midway Plaisance]]. Later, he connected a pair of frame barns to the main building to serve as male and female [[dormitory|dormitories]].  The structure was redesigned by the architectural firm of [[Pond and Pond]] to contain 13 studios for Taft and affiliated sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ead.lib.uchicago.edu/view-ead.xqy?id=ICU.SPCL.BG&amp;q=Pond+and+Pond&amp;c=a&amp;sub=Architecture+--+Illinois+--+Chicago+--+History&amp;page=#id1489898120|title=Guide to the University of Chicago Department of Building and Grounds Records: 1892-1965|publisher=University of Chicago|year=2006|work=University of Chicago Library, Series II, Subseries 3: Buildings|edition=J-R, Box 13, Folder 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lorado Taft: Sculptor and Citizen|author=Taft, Ada Bartlett|year=1946|publisher=Mary Taft Smith|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amos Alonzo Stagg Field''' is the name of two different [[American football|football]] fields for the [[University of Chicago]]. The earliest Stagg Field (1893-1957) is probably best remembered for its role in a landmark scientific achievement by [[Enrico Fermi]] during the [[Manhattan Project]]. The site of the first nuclear reaction received designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on February 18, 1965.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  On October 15, 1966, which is the day that the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] was enacted creating the [[National Register of Historic Places]], it was added to that as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was named a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 27, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteNuclear.html|accessdate=March 31, 2007|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Controlled Nuclear Chain Reaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Henry Moore]] sculpture, ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'', in a small quadrangle commemorates the location of the nuclear experiment.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=204&amp;ResourceType=Site Site of First Self-Sustaining Nuclear Reaction], NHL Database, ''National Historic Landmarks Program''.

==First nuclear chain reaction==
{{Main article|Chicago Pile-1}}
[[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first artificial [[nuclear reactor]], was built under the west stands of Stagg Field, which was no longer used for football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zug |first=J. |year=2003 |title=Squash, A History of the Game |pages=135–136 |publisher=[[Scribner (publisher)|Scribner]] |isbn=978-0-7432-2990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first man-made self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurred on December 2, 1942.

===First Stagg Field===
[[File:StaggField.JPG|thumb|right|Stagg Field in 1927 with the west stands in the foreground and the south stands (center-right) filled with spectators]]
The first Stagg Field was a [[stadium]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It was primarily used for [[American football|college football]] games, and was the home field of the [[Chicago Maroons football|Maroons]]. Stagg Field originally opened in 1893 as '''Marshall Field''', named after [[Marshall Field]] who donated land to the university to build the stadium.&lt;ref name=program&gt;&quot;[http://athletics.uchicago.edu/football/fb-program-2006.pdf 2006 Football Program],&quot; University of Chicago, pg. 35. Retrieved 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the field was renamed Stagg Field after their famous coach [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]]. The final capacity, after several stadium expansions, was 50,000. The University of Chicago discontinued its football program after 1939 and left the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. The stadium was demolished in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/03/05/the-way-things-work-nuclear-waste/ | title = The Way Things Work: Nuclear waste | accessdate = 2012-06-18 | publisher = The Chicago Maroon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the stadium site was re-utilized as the site of [[Regenstein Library]].

In addition to Maroons football, the stadium hosted other events. These include the 1936 [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|US Olympic Trials for Track and Field]] held June 19–20, 1936 and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships|Men's Track and Field Championships]] in [[1921 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1921]], [[1922 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1922]], [[1923 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1923]], [[1929 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1929]], [[1930 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1930]], [[1931 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1931]], [[1932 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1932]], [[1933 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1933]], and [[1936 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships|1936]].

[[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] also played a number home games at Stagg Field. At the turn of the 20th century, Northwestern was unable to handle large crowds, so they hosted then-powerhouse [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] at Marshall Field for a 1901 game and a 1904 game. In 1925 (a year prior to the opening of [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Dyche Stadium]]) Northwestern again was unable to accommodate large crowds, and as a result played two games at Stagg Field. The first was a notable win over [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]]. The second was an October 24 game against [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] that had originally been scheduled to be played at [[Soldier Field]] instead. Tulane won the game at Stagg Field 18-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hailtopurple.com/cde/homesites.html|title=Historic Sites of All NU Home Games|website= hailtopurple.com|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Michigan fight song &quot;[[The Victors]]&quot; was written by Michigan music student Louis Elbel in 1898, following a 12-11 Michigan victory over the University of Chicago at Stagg Field.

===New Stagg Field===
[[File:University of Chicago July 2013 41 (Stagg Field).jpg|thumb|right|Stagg Field in 2013]]
The current Stagg Field is an athletic field located several blocks to the northwest that preserves the Stagg Field name, as well as a relocated gate from the original facility. The school's current [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] football team uses the new field as their home. Stagg Field has a [[seating capacity]] of 1,650, and the playing surface is made of [[FieldTurf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://athletics.uchicago.edu/visitors/visitingguide.pdf | title = University of Chicago Ratner Center Visiting Guide | accessdate = 2010-07-15 | publisher = University of Chicago, Athletics Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicago Pile-1''' ('''CP-1'''), when it achieved [[Criticality (status)|criticality]], became the world's first artificial [[nuclear reactor]]. Its construction was part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the Allied effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s during [[World War II]]. It was built by the Manhattan Project's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]], under the west viewing stands of the original [[Stagg Field]]. The first human-made self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of [[Enrico Fermi]], who described the apparatus as &quot;a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers&quot;.{{sfn|Fermi|1982|p=24}}

The reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, [[Leo Szilard]], discoverer of the chain reaction, and [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Walter Zinn]], [[Martin D. Whitaker]], and [[George Weil]]. It contained 45,000 [[graphite]] blocks weighing {{convert|400|ST}} used as [[neutron moderator]]s, and was fueled by {{convert|6|ST}} of uranium metal and {{convert|50|ST}} of uranium oxide. In the pile, some of the free neutrons produced by the natural decay of uranium were absorbed by other uranium atoms, causing [[nuclear fission]] of those atoms, and the release of additional free neutrons. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it only operated at very low power. The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded, Fermi calculated that critical mass could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned.

In 1943, CP-1 was moved to [[Red Gate Woods]], and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957, but the site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[Chicago Landmark]].

==Origins==
The idea of [[chemical]] [[chain reaction]]s was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1956 – Award Ceremony Speech |first=Arne |last=Ölander |authorlink=Arne Ölander |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist [[Leo Szilard]] on 12 September 1933.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=13, 28}} Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced [[neutron]]s or [[dineutron]]s, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/05/16/szilards-chain-reaction/ |title=Szilard's chain reaction: visionary or crank? |publisher=Restricted Data |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leo |last=Szilard |authorlink=Leo Szilard |title=Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements, British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936) |url=http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB630726 |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=251–254}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hahn | first1 = O.| authorlink = Otto Hahn| last2 = Strassmann | first2 = F.| authorlink2= Fritz Strassmann| doi = 10.1007/BF01488241 | title = Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle (''On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons'') | journal = Die Naturwissenschaften | volume = 27 | pages = 11 | year = 1939 |bibcode = 1939NW.....27...11H }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]],{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=256–263}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lise |last=Meitner |authorlink=Lise Meitner |first2=O.

In order for a chain reaction to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At [[Columbia University]] in New York, [[Enrico Fermi]], [[John R. Dunning|John Dunning]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Eugene T. Booth]], [[G. N. Glasoe|G. Norris Glasoe]], and [[Francis G.

Pegram]], to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded [[Walter Zinn]] to become his collaborator.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=182–183}} They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of [[Pupin Hall]] at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=186–187}}

Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an [[atomic bomb]], and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|p=227}} Fermi urged [[Alfred O. C. Nier|Alfred O.C. Nier]] to separate [[uranium]] isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and on February 29th, 1940, Nier separated the first [[Uranium-235|U-235 isotope]] sample, which, after mailed to Columbia's [[cyclotron]], Dunning confirmed to be the isolated fissile material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/history/historicsites/nier.cfm|title=Alfred O. C.

Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, [[Franklin D.

In April 1941, the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), created a special project headed by [[Arthur Compton]], a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the [[University of Chicago]], to report on the uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing [[radiological weapon]]s, [[nuclear propulsion]] for ships, and [[nuclear weapons]] using [[uranium-235]] or the recently discovered [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=36–38}} In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the [[critical mass]] of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for [[uranium enrichment]] with [[Harold Urey]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

[[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic [[mass number]]s were [[fissile]]. If so, then [[plutonium-239]] was likely to be.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}} In May 1941, [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Glenn Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] there, and found that it had 1.7 times the [[thermal neutron]] capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and it was not possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=192–193}} Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a [[nuclear reactor]], and with [[Robert Serber]] about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with [[Ernest Lawrence]], Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=50–51}} Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=82}} It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=180–181}} He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}

In a nuclear reactor, [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including both neutron absorption and neutron leakage. When a [[uranium]]-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/sgnucdat/a6.htm|title=Nuclear Data for Safeguards|last=International Atomic Energy Agency|first=|authorlink=International Atomic Energy Agency|date=|website=www-nds.iaea.org|publisher=|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the simplest case of an [[neutron reflector|unreflected]], homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be:{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_{crit} =  \frac{\pi M}{\sqrt{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''M'' is the surface area and ''k'' is the average [[four factor formula|neutron multiplication factor]]. The neutrons in preceding reactions will be amplified by a factor ''k'', the second generation of fission events will produce ''k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', the third ''k&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' and so on. In order for a [[self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction]] to occur, ''k'' must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, ''k'' must be greater than 1 without crossing the [[Prompt criticality|prompt critical]] threshold that would result in a rapid, [[Exponential growth|exponential increase]] in the number of fission events.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=396–397}}

Fermi christened his apparatus a &quot;pile&quot;. Emilio Segrè later recalled that:{{quote|I thought for a while that this term was used to refer to a source of nuclear energy in analogy with [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]]'s use of the Italian term ''pila'' to denote his own great invention of a source of electrical energy. I was disillusioned by Fermi himself, who told me that he simply used the common English word ''pile'' as synonymous with ''heap''. To my surprise, Fermi never seemed to have thought of the relationship between his ''pile'' and Volta's.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=116}} }}

Another grant, this time of $40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was {{convert|8|ft}} long, {{convert|8|ft}} wide and {{convert|11|ft}} high.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=86}} This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: {{quote|We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who could carry out magic around the University, and we explained to him that we needed a big room. He scouted around the campus and we went with him to dark corridors and under various heating pipes and so on, to visit possible sites for this experiment and eventually a big room was discovered in Schermerhorn Hall.{{sfn|Embrey|1970|p=385}} }}

[[File:HD.5A.025 (10692802156).jpg|thumb|left|One of at least 29 experimental piles that were constructed in 1942 under the West Stands of Stagg Field. Each tested elements incorporated into the final design.]]
The pile was built in September 1941 from {{convert|4|by|4|by|12|in|cm|adj=on}} graphite blocks and [[tinplate]] iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were {{convert|8|by|8|by|8|in|cm|adj=on}} cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about {{convert|60|lb}}. There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A [[Neutron source#Radioisotopes which decay with alpha particles packed in a low-Z elemental matrix|radium-beryllium neutron source]] was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's [[American football|football]] team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing ''k'' of 0.87.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=396–397}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=86–87}}

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia University, [[Princeton University]], the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the [[Midwest]], where war work had not yet taken them away.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}} In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=88}}

Before leaving for Chicago, Fermi's team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to {{convert|480|F|C}} to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes {{convert|3|in|cm}} long and {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture. The result was a ''k'' of 0.918.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=400–401}}

In Chicago, [[Samuel K. Allison]] had found a suitable location {{convert|60|ft}} long, {{convert|30|ft}} wide and {{convert|26|ft}} high, sunk slightly below ground level, in a space under the stands at [[Stagg Field]] originally built as a [[rackets (sport)|rackets]] court.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=401}}{{sfn|Zug|2003|pp=134–135}} Stagg Field had been largely unused since the University of Chicago had given up playing American football in 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/sports/ncaafootball/at-the-university-of-chicago-football-and-higher-education-mix.html |accessdate=2 December 2015 |title=Where Football and Higher Education Mix |first=Barry |last=Bearak |date=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rackets courts under West Stands were still used for playing [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[handball]]. [[Leona Woods]] and [[Anthony L. Turkevich]] played squash there in 1940. Since it was intended for strenuous exercise, the area was unheated, and very cold in the winter. The nearby North Stands had a pair of ice skating rinks on the ground floor, which although they were unrefrigerated, seldom melted in winter.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=86}} Allison used the rackets court area to construct a {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} experimental pile before Fermi's group arrived in 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=401}}

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] assumed control of the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] became part of what came to be called the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=74–75}} [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] became director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=427–428}} He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory for the first time on 5 October.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=431}} Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=91}}

Fermi designed a new pile, which would be spherical to maximize ''k'', which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=429}} Leona Woods was detailed to build [[boron trifluoride]] [[neutron detector]]s as soon as she completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the large number of {{convert|4|by|6|in|cm|adj=on}} timbers required at lumber yards in [[Chicago's south side]].{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=85}} Shipments of high-purity graphite arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity [[uranium dioxide]] from [[Mallinckrodt]] in St Louis, which was now producing {{convert|30|ST}} a month.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=430}} Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=65–66, 83–88}}

On 25 June, the Army and the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) had selected a site in the [[Red Gate Woods|Argonne Forest]] near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant. This became known as Site A. {{convert|1025|acres}} were leased from [[Cook County]] in August,{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=67–68}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fpdcc.com/site-a/ |title=Red Gate Woods: 'Site A' |publisher=Forest Preserves of Cook County |accessdate=26 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=71–72, 111–114}} The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}

[[File:HD.5A.027 (10542723446).jpg|thumb|left|upright|CP-1 under construction: 4th layer]]
The risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic [[nuclear meltdown]] blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a [[Criticality accident|runaway reaction]]. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}} The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind [[fission product]]s that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=17}}

Fermi argued that by using the [[delayed neutron]]s, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the [[prompt neutron]]s from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or [[neutron poison]], is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with [[electromechanical]] [[control system]]s such as [[control rod]]s. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety,{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136–137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}} and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}}

Compton later explained that:{{quote|As a responsible officer of the University of Chicago, according to every rule of organizational protocol, I should have taken the matter to my superior. But this would have been unfair. [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|President Hutchins]] was in no position to make an independent judgment of the hazards involved. Based on considerations of the University's welfare, the only answer he could have given would have been—no. And this answer would have been wrong.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}} }}
Compton informed Groves of his decision at the 14 November meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107–109}} Although Groves &quot;had serious misgivings about the wisdom of Compton's suggestion&quot;, he did not interfere.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=53}} [[James B. Conant]], the chairman of the NDRC, was reported to have turned white. But because of the urgency and their confidence in Fermi's calculations, no one objected.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=66}}

==Construction==
[[File:HD.5A.026 (10692858884).jpg|thumb|right|upright|CP-1 under construction: 7th layer]]

Chicago Pile 1 was encased within a balloon so that the air inside could be replaced by [[carbon dioxide]]. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]]. A {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=91}}{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|p=197}} A [[block and tackle]] was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=436}}

The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=91–92}} For a work force they hired thirty high school dropouts that were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the Army.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}} They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/features/how_the_first_chain_reaction_changed_science/|title=How the first chain reaction changed science|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in {{convert|4.25|by|4.25|in|cm|adj=on}} bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of {{convert|16.5|in|cm}}, each weighing {{convert|19|lb}}. A lathe was used to drill {{convert|3.25|in|cm|adj=on}} holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into &quot;pseudospheres&quot;, cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Graphite dust soon filled the air and made the floor slippery.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137–138}}

Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was responsible for instrumentation.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=91–92}} They also fabricated the [[control rods]], which were [[cadmium]] sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the [[scram]] line, a [[Manila rope]] that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}} Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a [[variable resistor]], controlling an [[electric motor]] that would [[wikt:spool|spool]] the [[clothesline]] wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would [[fail-safe]] and return to its zero position when released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825162412/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |journal=ORNL Review |issn=0048-1262 |title=Chapter 1: Wartime Laboratory |volume=25 |issue=3 and 4 |year=2002 |accessdate=22 March 2016 |archivedate=25 August 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two layers were laid per shift.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Woods' boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=119}} Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and {{convert|6|ST}} of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the [[Ames Project]] at [[Iowa State University]],{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=434}} where a team under [[Frank Spedding]] had developed [[Ames process|a new process]] to produce uranium metal. [[Westinghouse Lamp Plant]] supplied {{convert|3|ST}}, which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The {{convert|2.25|in|cm|adj=on}} metallic uranium cylinders, known as &quot;Spedding's eggs&quot;, were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi's new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=93}} When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, {{convert|20|ft}} high, {{convert|6|ft}} wide at the ends and {{convert|25|ft}} across the middle.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fermi|first=Enrico|date=1952|title=Experimental Production of a Divergent Chain Reaction|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/20/9/10.1119/1.1933322|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=20|issue=9|pages=536–558|doi=10.1119/1.1933322|issn=0002-9505|pmid=|access-date=|via=|bibcode=1952AmJPh..20..536F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained {{convert|6|ST}} of uranium metal, {{convert|50|ST}} of uranium oxide and {{convert|400|ST}} of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=16–17}}

The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector in a loud voice, [[George Weil]], the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but {{convert|13|ft}} of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it {{convert|6|in|cm}} at a time, with measurements being taken at each step.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-1 Goes Critical&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Libby|1979|pp=120–123}}

The process was abruptly halted by the automatic control rod reinserting itself, due to its trip level being set too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.waltpatterson.org/georgeweil.pdf |title=George Weil - from activator to activist |accessdate=25 March 2016 |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issn=0262-4079 |volume=56 |issue=822 |date=30 November 1972 |pp=530–531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then announced that it was lunch time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-1 Goes Critical&quot; /&gt;

The experiment resumed at 14:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-1 Goes Critical&quot; /&gt; Weil worked the final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi announced that the pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=174}}{{sfn|Libby|1979|pp=120–123}} The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=440}} Wigner opened a bottle of [[Chianti]], which they drank from paper cups.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=95}}

Compton notified Conant by telephone. The conversation was in an impromptu code:

==Later operation==
On 12 December 1942 CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity, and further testing was continued at 0.5 W.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=3.9}} Operation was terminated on 28 February 1943,{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=23}} and the pile was dismantled and moved to Site A in the Argonne Forest, now known as Red Gate Woods.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp1anl&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about {{convert|25|ft}} tall with a base approximately {{convert|30|ft}} square. It was surrounded by concrete walls {{convert|5|ft}} thick that acted as a [[radiation shield]]ing, with overhead protection from {{convert|6|in|cm}} of lead and {{convert|50|in|cm}} of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained {{convert|52|ST}} of uranium and {{convert|472|ST}} of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a ''k'' of 1.055.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=3.13}}{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=428}}&lt;ref name=&quot;fermi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fermi | first=Enrico | title=The Development of the first chain reaction pile | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] | year=1946 | volume=90 | pp=20–24| jstor=3301034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;waste&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/03/05/the-way-things-work-nuclear-waste/ |title=The Way Things Work: Nuclear waste |newspaper=The Chicago Maroon |date=5 March 2009 |first=Claire |last=McNear  |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CP-2 was joined by [[Chicago Pile-3]], the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=428}}&lt;ref name=&quot;fermi&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Marker at Site A.jpg|thumb|left | alt=Image of the granite marker. The text reads: &quot;The world's first nuclear reactor was rebuilt at this site in 1943 after initial operation at the University of Chicago. This reactor (CP-2) and the first heavy water moderated reactor (CP-3) where major facilities around which developed the Argonne National Laboratory. This site was released by the laboratory in 1956 and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission then buried the reactors here.&quot;|Commemorative boulder at Site A]]
The reactors were used to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of [[tritium]]. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 over the course of a year.{{sfn|Wattenberg|1975|p=123}} An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his [[white blood cell]] count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

The Red Gate Woods later became the original site of [[Argonne National Laboratory]], which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|p=47}} CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt; Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to [[Chicago Pile-5]] at the Argonne National Laboratory's new site in [[DuPage County]], and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], for disposal. The rest was encased in concrete and buried in a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} trench in what is now known as the [[Site A/Plot M Disposal Site]]. It is marked by a commemorative boulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Szilard and Hilberry.jpg|upright|thumb|Leo Szilard (right) and Norman Hilberry under the plaque commemorating Chicago Pile-1 on the West Stands of Old Stagg Field. While the stands were later demolished, the plaque is now located at [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|the site memorial.]]]]
By the 1970s there was increased public concern about the levels of radioactivity at the site, which was used by the local residents for recreational purposes. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found [[strontium-90]] in the soil at Plot M, trace amounts of tritium in nearby wells, and plutonium, technetium, cesium, and uranium in the area. In 1994, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the Argonne National Laboratory yielded to public pressure and earmarked $24.7 million and $3.4 million respectively to rehabilitate the site. As part of the clean up, {{convert|500|cuyd}} of radioactive waste was removed and sent to the [[Hanford Site]] for disposal. By 2002, the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]] had determined that the remaining materials posed no danger to public health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site A&quot;/&gt;

==Significance and commemoration==
A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=26 July 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/07/26/page/17/article/u-of-c-to-raze-stagg-fields-atomic-cradle |title=U. of C. to Raze Stagg Field's Atomic Cradle |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It read: {{quote|On December 2, 1942 man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;plaques&quot;/&gt; }} The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=16 August 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/08/16/page/30/article/remove-nuclear-site-plaque |title=Remove Nuclear Site Plaque |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of CP-1 was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 18 February 1965.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; When the [[National Register of Historic Places]] was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; The site was also named a [[Chicago Landmark]] on 27 October 1971.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite web |title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Controlled Nuclear Chain Reaction |url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1383 |publisher=[[City of Chicago]] |accessdate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nuclear Energy''''' is a [[bronze]] sculpture by [[Henry Moore]] that is located on the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] at the site of the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], [[Chicago Pile-1]].  The first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated here on December 2, 1942.

==Location==
''Nuclear Energy'' is located on Ellis Avenue, between the [[Max Palevsky Residential Commons|Max Palevsky West dormitory]] and the [[Mansueto Library]] in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]].  The location commemorates the exact location where the [[Manhattan Project]] team devised the first nuclear reactor to produce the first self-sustaining controlled [[nuclear reaction]] under the now demolished west stands of the old [[Stagg Field]].&lt;ref name=NES&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=121J354443PW7.6174&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!296234~!75&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Moore,+Henry+Spencer,+1898-1986,+sculptor.&amp;index=&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=3|title=Nuclear Energy, (sculpture).|accessdate=July 18, 2008|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Benjamin F. Ferguson|B. F. Ferguson]] monument fund.&lt;ref name=TRoMiMGaAS&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1574334|title=The Role of Materials in My Geometric and Abstract Sculpture: A Memoir|date=Winter 1982|author=Greene-Mercier, Marie Zoe|publisher=|work=Leonardo|volume=15|pages=1–6|doi=10.2307/1574334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s a rather strange thing really but I’d already done the idea for this sculpture before [[William H. McNeill (historian)|Professor McNeill]] and his colleagues from the University of Chicago came to see me on Sunday morning to tell me about the whole proposition. They told me (which I’d only vaguely known) that [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]], the Italian nuclear physicist, started or really made the first successful controlled nuclear fission in a temporary building. I think it was a squash court - a wooden building - which from the outside looked entirely unlike where a thing of such an important nature might take place. But this experiment was carried on in secret and it meant that by being successful Man was able to control this huge force for peaceful purposes as well as destructive ones. They came to me to tell me that they thought where such an important event in history took place ought to be marked and they wondered whether I would do a sculpture which would stand on the spot. (Henry Moore quoted in ''Art Journal'', New York, spring 1973, p.286)&lt;ref name=&quot;henry-moore-fdn1964&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/works-in-public/world/united-states-of-america/chicago/university-of-chicago/nuclear-energy-1964-66-lh-526 |title=Henry Moore - Works in Public - Nuclear Energy 1964-66 (LH 526) |publisher=Henry-moore-fdn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sculpture is described as {{convert|14.0|ft|m}} in height and {{convert|8|ft|m}} in [[diameter]] by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Energy, (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=121J354443PW7.6174&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!296234~!75&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Moore,+Henry+Spencer,+1898-1986,+sculptor.&amp;index=&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=3|work=Art Inventories|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it sits atop a base that is {{convert|1.5|ft|m}} in height and {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=NES/&gt;  However, the University of Chicago says it is only {{convert|12|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref name=NE/&gt;  The [[Henry Moore Foundation]] lists its height at 3.66m.&lt;ref name=&quot;henry-moore-fdn1964&quot;/&gt; The sculpture reminds some of the [[human skull]], while it reminds others of an atomic [[mushroom cloud]].&lt;ref name=NE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.uchicago.edu/moore_sculpture.html|title=Nuclear Energy|accessdate=July 18, 2008|publisher=The University of Chicago Department of Physics |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080520025154/http://physics.uchicago.edu/moore_sculpture.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture was erected for and dedicated at the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the initiation of the first self-sustaining controlled nuclear reaction on the grounds by Fermi on December 2, 1942.  Thus, it was dedicated at precisely 3:36&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 2, 1967.&lt;ref name=NES/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRoMiMGaAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=NE/&gt; The site of the first nuclear reaction received designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on February 18, 1965 and was added to the newly created [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on October 15, 1966 as one of the original designated historic places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=204&amp;ResourceType=Site|title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Nuclear Reaction |accessdate=July 17, 2008|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago Pile-1 is one of four [[List of Registered Historic Places in Chicago|Chicago NRHPs]] on the original list.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was named a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 27, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/LandmarksWeb/landmarkDetail.do;jsessionid=L1HTcBF85WsbdWR58fFGQFc44K2Tvqsn6LxTV7jQbxM1Ymnl84FG!941869876?lanID=1383|title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Controlled Nuclear Chain Reaction|accessdate=July 17, 2008|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four plaques are placed on a nearby granite wall marking the site.

The '''University of Chicago Band''' is a [[pep band]] and a [[marching band]] (of the [[scramble band]] variety) for the [[University of Chicago]].  The Band was founded in 1898, five years after the university opened.

==History==
University President William Rainey Harper organized the group in Autumn 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Uchicago marching band history| url= http://band.uchicago.edu/Site/History.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first concert was held on December 16, 1898 in an auditorium in Kent Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pjnOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 Books.google.com] &quot;The military band of the university.&quot; The University of Chicago magazine, volume IX, number 3, January 1917, pages 105-112.  Retrieved September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Amos Alonzo Stagg, football coach and head of the Athletic Department at the time, was eager for a band to support his teams. He incorporated the band into the Athletic Department and provided it with a budget for travel, equipment, and uniforms. The uniforms consisted of maroon sweaters and ties with white shirts and trousers. In cold weather, the bandsmen also wore overcoats and caps.

The band's original primary purpose was to support the football team in their matchups against other Midwestern and East Coast universities. Typical opponents of the time included such schools as Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Northwestern, and other universities known today as football powerhouses. In fact, the University of Chicago has a perfect 4-0 record against Notre Dame in football; the most recent matchup between the two schools took place in 1899.

The Band was originally called the UC Military Band, although it had no affiliation with any form of the Armed Forces at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= UC military band| url= http://band.uchicago.edu/Site/History.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, during World War I, almost every male member of the band enlisted in some branch of the federal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Involvement in WWI| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOMqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band lived up to its name during World War II when it became a color guard military band.

With a fluctuating membership of 50 to 100 musicians, the band performed field maneuvers in the classic Big Ten style, spelling out letters and words as wells as forming pictures. However, it added its own zany twist to shows with balloons, confetti, and singing along with the more traditional elements of its performance.

The band performed at all home football games at Stagg Field, which stood on the current site of the Regenstein Library. It also travelled to at least one road game each year. In addition to performances at football games, basketball games, and other athletic events, the band put on concerts on a regular basis in Mandel Hall.

For many years, the band possessed permanent rehearsal and storage space underneath the stands of Stagg Field. In 1941 the band moved to new quarters in the basement of the Music Building at 5727 S. University Ave., currently called the Statistics and Mathematics Building.

[[Image:Whole band.jpg|left|thumb|thumb|The University of Chicago Band]]
The UC Band's fate took a dramatic turn in 1939 when the University cancelled intercollegiate football. However, the organization survived as a concert band for several more years. It seems to have disappeared entirely sometime during World War II. The group reappeared in 1955 as a basketball band. Since then, the band has gone through several periods of activity and inactivity.

The band has had a number of directors throughout its history. The most famous was Harold Bachman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Harold Bachman| url= http://www.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=/MdU.ead.scpa.0060.xml&amp;style=ead }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nationally renowned band leader, who served from 1935 until the band's demise sometime in the early 1940s.
The current pep band does not have a professional director. Student members take the responsibility for musical and administrative leadership. The band continues to perform regularly at intercollegiate matches in football, men's basketball, and women's basketball.

===Big Bertha===
[[Image:Apf4-01704r.jpg|right|thumb|The University of Chicago Band With Big Bertha]]

The band's most notable and memorable feature was its bass drum. Known as [[Big Bertha (drum)|Big Bertha]], the drum measured eight feet in diameter and required a crew of six members, four to push the drum and two to beat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Big Bertha| url= http://www.utexas.edu/friends/fun.php?which=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Purdue University]] brought [[Purdue Big Bass Drum|its own large bass drum]] to a 1921 Chicago-Purdue football game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.purdue.edu/UNS/html3month/020702.Matter.BBDhistory.html | title=Purdue's Big Bass Drum makes long-awaited return to Chicago | accessdate=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Bertha was donated in 1922 by C. D. Greenleaf, the president of C. G. Conn Company, a well-known manufacturer of instruments in Indiana. Greenleaf was a Chicago alumnus and an original member of the band. Along with the drum, he gave 100 instruments to the band, each bearing an engraved copy of the university seal. Big Bertha was so large that it could not fit through the doors of Mandel Hall; thus it could not be used during the band's indoor concerts.

The drum rested on a cart supported on airplane tires.  Mr. Greenleaf sent a representative to the Chicago stockyards to select the largest steers found in the Chicago Stockyards, and had the drum built around drumheads made from their hides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Big Bertha| url= http://photofiles.lib.uchicago.edu/db.xqy?one=apf4-01703.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Apf4-01703r.jpg|thumb|left|Close up of Big Bertha]]
When the university canceled intercollegiate football in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cancellation of intercollegiate football| url=http://band.uchicago.edu/Site/History.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Bertha (drum)|Big Bertha]] went into seclusion for a number of years.  It was hidden underneath Stagg Field, the old football stadium.   Since the first nuclear reactor occurred under the stadium, Big Bertha later became contaminated by radiation from the atomic bomb research during the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Big Bertha Radiation| url=http://www.music.utexas.edu/LonghornBand/History/Bertha.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Big Bertha came out of seclusion when a movie about the life of the great John Philip Sousa was to be made and was offered a role in the film, &quot;Stars and Stripes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Role in movie| url=http://www.music.utexas.edu/LonghornBand/History/Bertha.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Colonel D. Harold Byrd, a long-time benefactor of the Longhorn Band, purchased Bertha from the University of Chicago and gave it a new home in the heart of Texas. Mr. Moton Crockett, former Director of the Longhorn Band, constructed a special trailer for the storage and transportation.  The permanent dwelling is in the comfort of the University of Texas at Austin's large Band Hall.  Big Bertha is currently owned and used on a regular basis by [[The University of Texas Longhorn Band]].

'''Conrad Johan (John) Immanuel Bergendoff''' (December 3, 1895 &amp;ndash;December 23, 1997) was an American [[Lutheran]] theologian and historian. He served as the fifth president of [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]] from 1935 to 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;augie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Conrad John Immanuel Bergendoff (1895-1997)|url=http://www.augustana.edu/x18013.xml|work=Presidents of Augustana College|publisher=Augustana College|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Conrad Bergendoff was born in [[Shickley, Nebraska]], to Carl August and Emma Mathilda Fahlberg Bergendoff. He spent his youth in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. He graduated from [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois]] in 1915 and earned his M.A. at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1916. He returned to [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] to complete the B. Div. degree at the [Augustana Theological Seminary.
Bergendoff was ordained into the ministry of the [[Augustana Lutheran Synod]] on June 12, 1921 in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Augustana Ministerium&quot; (1980). Augustana Historical Society. ISBN 0-910184-28-3&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued advanced study at Sweden's [[Uppsala University]], serving as personal secretary to Swedish Archbishop [[Nathan Söderblom]] during the Stockholm Conference on  Life and Work in 1925. He earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;augie&quot; /&gt;

== Career ==
Bergendoff became dean of the Augustana Theological Seminary in 1931, and was elected to succeed [[Gustav Andreen]] as president of [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in 1935.  He saw the college through the difficult years of the [[Great Depression]], through its separation from Augustana Theological Seminary in 1948, and into a long period of substantial growth and increasing prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;augie&quot; /&gt;

Among his most notable achievements was the ecumenical spirit he engendered in American Lutherans from the late 1930s going forward.  Instrumental in gathering together the myriad branches of the European immigrant Lutheran bodies, Bergendoff used his considerable influence and power within the Augustana Synod to help unite those  Swedish-background churches into the United Lutheran Church in America (1962-1987), a precursor of the current [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].  Bergendoff also devoted considerable attention to the ecumenical movement between major Protestant denominations, and on a more local and regional level he made many inroads towards official cooperation with leaders of conservative and reformed movements in American Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm/ref/collection/npu_sahq/id/4409|title=Conrad Bergendoff (1895-1997)|publisher=Swedish-American Historical Quarterly. v.49, no.2. p. 156-158|date=April 1998|accessdate= March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Su-Shu Huang''' ({{lang|zh|黃授書}}, April 16, 1915&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; September 15, 1977) was a Chinese-born [[United States|American]] astrophysicist. A graduate of the [[University of Chicago]], Huang began his career with the study of the [[attenuation coefficient|continuous absorption coefficient]]s of two-[[electron]] systems, but eventually his research focus turned to the study of [[stellar atmosphere]]s, [[radiative zone|radiative transfer]], and [[binary star|binary]] and [[multiple star system]]s. In subsequent years, Huang began to cover the topic of life on [[extrasolar planet]]s and the prerequisites thereof, coining the term &quot;[[habitable zone]]&quot; to refer to the region around a star where planets could support liquid water at their surfaces at a 1959 conference of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=asp-1959&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40673575 | title=The Problem of Life in the Universe and the Mode of Star Formation | author=Huang, Su-Shu | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |date=October 1959 | volume=71 | issue=422 | pages=421&amp;ndash;424 | bibcode=1959PASP...71..421H|doi = 10.1086/127417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
A native of [[China]], Huang earned his master's degree at Tsing Hua University, lecturing in astronomy at that institution from 1943 to 1947 before immigrating to the United States, earning a doctorate in astronomy from the University of Chicago in 1949. After teaching astronomy at that institution for the two following years, Huang became an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, a position he stayed in before moving to the Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Maryland]] in 1959. Concurrent with his Goddard position, Huang was a member of [[Princeton University]]'s Institute for Advanced Study from 1960 to 1961, then a professor of astrophysics at the Catholic University of America from 1963 to 1964. In 1964, Huang became professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University, though he stayed at Goddard until 1965.&lt;ref name=northwestern&gt;{{cite web | url=http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/inu-ead-nua-archon-583 | title=Guide to the Su-Shu Huang (1915&amp;ndash;1977) Papers | publisher=Northwestern University Library | work=Archival and Manuscript Collections | date=1944–1980 | accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years he studied two-electron systems, Huang later studied stellar atmospheres, [[radiative zone]]s, and the dynamics of stars in binary or multiple star systems. Huang's research into the physics of stars later led him to delineate the types of stars that could support [[extraterrestrial life]], leading to his coining of the term &quot;habitable zone&quot;&lt;ref name=asp-1959 /&gt; and eventually his study of [[planetary habitability]] in a 1960 paper on the sizes of habitable planets.&lt;ref name=asp-1960&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Sizes of Habitable Planets | author=Huang, Su-Shu | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | year=1960 | volume=72 | issue=429 | pages=489&amp;mdash;493|bibcode = 1960PASP...72..489H |doi = 10.1086/127586 |jstor=40676939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang's explorations into extraterrestrial life were also published in popular works, such as ''[[American Scientist]]''&lt;ref name=amsci&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=27827376 | title=Occurrence of Life in the Universe | author=Huang, Su-Shu | journal=American Scientist |date=September 1959 | volume=47 | issue=3 | pages=397&amp;mdash;402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = S.

== Later life and legacy ==
Late in his life, Huang made two trips to China, in 1974 and 1977. He died of a [[heart attack]] in Beijing during the latter trip, on September 15.&lt;ref name=northwestern /&gt; Two years after his death, the then newly discovered [[main-belt asteroid]] [[3014 Huangsushu]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpl&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=3014%20Huangsushu | title=3014 Huangsushu | publisher=Minor Planet Center | work=JPL Small-Body Database | accessdate=17 July 2013 | author=Minor Planet Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Chicago sit-ins''' were a series of [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] protests at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1962. The protests were called to end the reported segregation of students in the university.

==Events==
===Dialogue===
According to ''[[The Chicago Maroon|Chicago Maroon]]'' managing editor Avima Ruder, a staffer at the student paper found a copy of the University budget, and &quot;we discovered that the University owned a lot of segregated apartment buildings...It was really bizarre because our student population at that point was largely white, but there was no segregation, there weren’t separate dorms for African American students—if someone had suggested that, people would have been appalled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Core&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Muhlenkamp |first=Katherine |url=http://thecore.uchicago.edu/Summer2012/features/paper-trail.shtml |title=Aristotle Schwartz leaves. Malcolm X debates. The Chicago Seven feast. Maroon reporters were there. |work=The Core; College Magazine of the University of Chicago |date=2012 |accessdate=2015-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially foregoing publishing the news, editors gave the apartment addresses to the Student Government, who reached out to the university chapter of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) to &quot;conduct six test cases in which African American students attempted and failed to secure apartments in the segregated buildings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Core&quot;/&gt; Student Government and CORE confronted President  [[George Wells Beadle]] with their findings and demanded the buildings be desegregated. On January 17, 1962, the Maroon broke the story on the front page of the paper, with the headline, &quot;UC Admits Housing Segregation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Core&quot;/&gt; Beadle wrote a letter to the paper, agreeing that the university segregation was a problem, emphasized the University’s nondiscrimination policy and the difference between on-campus housing, which was open to all, and commercial residential properties acquired by the University, many of which had existing segregation policies. &quot;The only issue on which there is arguable difference of opinion,&quot; Beadle wrote, &quot;is the rate at which it is possible to move toward the agreed objective without losing more than is gained.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Core&quot;/&gt;

===Protests===
Frustrated with Beadle’s call for &quot;planned, stable integration,&quot; CORE activist [[Bernie Sanders]] led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president [[George Wells Beadle]]'s segregated campus housing policy. “We feel it is an intolerable situation, when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university owned apartments,” Sanders said at the protest. Sanders then strode into the building, along with 32 other students and camped out outside the president’s office, performing the first civil rights [[sit-in]] in Chicago history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |url=http://time.com/3896500/bernie-sanders-vermont-campaign-radical/ |title=The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders |work=Time Magazine |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2015-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |url=http://mag.uchicago.edu/law-policy-society/political-education |title=A political education |work=The University of Chicago Magazine |date=January 2015|accessdate=2015-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the Barack Obama Foundation and Chicago mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] announced that the Foundation and the Barack Obama Presidential Center would be located in Chicago's South Side and would be built in partnership with the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;May2015Announcement&quot;&gt;Julie Bosman &amp; Mitch Smith, [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/us/chicago-president-obama-library.html?_r=0 Chicago Wins Bid to Host Obama Library], ''New York Times'' (May 12, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of [[Chicago's South Side]] has broad local support for reasons of civic pride as well as of the [[economic development]] it would bring in the form of [[tourism in Chicago|tourism]] and jobs, although the nonprofit group Friends of the Parks opposes the loss of parkland to build the library and has threatened a lawsuit to block development.&lt;ref name=&quot;May2015Announcement&quot;/&gt;

A design advisory committee assisted in the selection of the architects. Members of the committee included sculptor [[Don Gummer]] (the husband of actress [[Meryl Streep]]); [[Ed Schlossberg]] of ESI Design (husband of [[Caroline Kennedy]], the [[United States Ambassador to Japan|U.S. ambassador to Japan]]); [[Fred Eychaner]], a Chicago radio station owner and Democratic financier; and ''[[Architectural Digest]]'' magazine editor [[Margaret Russell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchTech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kamin|last1=Blair|title=Husbands of Streep and Kennedy advising on Obama Center architect|url=http://chicagotribune.com/news/obamalibrary/ct-obama-library-architect-panel-met-20160113-story.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven [[architectural firm]]s were announced as finalists in December 2015 from an initial list of 140 applicants:&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchTech&quot;/&gt;  John Ronan Architects, [[David Adjaye|Adjaye Associates]],  Diller Scofidio + Renfro, [[Renzo Piano]] Building Workshop, SHoP Architects, [[Snøhetta_(company)|Snøhetta]], Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Sweet, [http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/seven-firms-make-cut-to-design-obama-center-in-chicago/ Seven firms make cut to design Obama Center in Chicago],  ''Chicago Sun Times'' 12/21/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Two firms, New York-based [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects]] and Chicago-based Interactive Design Architects, were chosen in June 2016 to jointly lead the design and engineering of the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiTri30Jun16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Obamas choose New York architects to design Chicago library and museum|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obamalibrary/ct-obama-library-architect-met-20160630-story.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barackobamafoundation.org/news/entry/Architect-Selection-Announcement |title=The Obama Foundation Announces Architect Selection for Future Presidential Center |publisher=The Obama Foundation |date=2016-06-30 |accessdate=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''James Franck Institute''' of the [[University of Chicago]] conducts interdisciplinary research in physics, chemistry and materials science. Scientists at the institute include those interested in condensed matter physics, physical chemistry, synthetic materials chemistry, atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, geophysics, and biophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfi.uchicago.edu/aboutinstitute/director.shtml|title=James Franck Institute: About the Institute Director|author=|date=|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1945 by university President [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], as the Institute for the Study of Metals, it was renamed for Nobel Prize winning physicist [[James Franck]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfi.uchicago.edu/aboutinstitute/documents/50th_anniv_chronology.shtml|title=James Franck Institute: About the Institute History|author=|date=|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoddeson&gt;{{cite book | title=Out of the Crystal Maze : Chapters from The History of Solid State Physics | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Hoddeson, Lillian, et.al | year=1992 | location=New York | pages=208 | isbn=019505329X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had its beginnings in the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], the World War II project that initiated [[Chicago Pile-1|the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction]], using the metal uranium.  The Institute's founding director was [[Cyril Stanley Smith]], former head of metallurgy at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] and the institute made early advances in pseudopotential theory and study of the [[Fermi surface]].&lt;ref name=Hoddeson/&gt;  According to a history written by Lillian Hoddeson and others, the Institute was an early pioneer in interdisciplinary research in wide ranging subjects: as it was organized like a &quot;benevolent anarchy&quot;, a large percent of its early papers did not even deal with metals but other aspects of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name=Hoddeson/&gt;

'''59th Street/University of Chicago''' is a [[railway station]] serves the [[Metra Electric Line]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The station is on 59th street, originally the [[University of Chicago]]'s southern border, and the [[Midway Plaisance]]. Trains run between [[Millennium Station]] downtown and [[University Park, Illinois|University Park]], [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]], and the Chicago's neighborhood of [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago]], the three southern branches. Before the [[57th Street (Metra)|57th Street Station]] to the immediate north was rebuilt into a major station in 2002, all express trains served 59th Street and the station had a staffed ticket window.

The majority of University of Chicago and [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] traffic is now served by the [[57th Street (Metra)|57th Street Station]]; only some express trains stop at 59th Street. It is more dilapidated than the modern 57th street station and there have been discussions to demolish it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} These plans were confirmed in December 2015 when Metra announced its plan to close the 59th Street station and further add service to the 55th-56th-57th Street station. These plans also included adding ticket agents at 55th-56th-57th Street, Homewood, Flossmoor, and University Park.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''WHPK''' (88.5 [[FM radio|FM]])&lt;ref name=TimeOutChi2011/&gt; is an American [[radio station]] based in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]], established in 1968. The station is owned by the [[University of Chicago]], and operated by volunteer students and community members. WHPK's station manager and program director are elected by the station's student members and must be students themselves. The station's [[Broadcast engineering|broadcast engineer]] is paid by the university.

==History==
[[Image:Reynoldsclub.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Mitchell Tower, [[University of Chicago]] Reynolds Club building where the station's studios are located.]]
In 1968, WHPK-FM was established when the campus secret Society of the Owl and Serpent disbanded, donating its funds and Reynolds Club office space to a student radio group. WHPK-FM started broadcasting as a 15-watt FM station at 88.3&amp;nbsp;MHz on March 22, 1968.

The '''Gerald Ratner Athletics Center''' is a $51 million athletics facility within the [[University of Chicago]] campus in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], Illinois in the United States. The building was named after University of Chicago alumnus, [[Gerald Ratner (lawyer)|Gerald Ratner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140620/NEWS04/130909947/lawyer-gerald-ratner-dies-at-100-crown-family-adviser-u-of-c-donor# |title=Crain's Chicago Business : Subscription Center |publisher=Chicagobusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of this suspension structure that is supported by [[Wikt:mast|mast]]s, [[cable]]s and [[counterweight]]s was [[César Pelli]], who is best known as the architect of the [[Petronas Towers]].

The Ratner Athletics Center was approved for use in September 2003. The facility includes, among other things: a competition [[gym]]nasium, a multilevel fitness facility, an Olympic-sized [[swimming pool]], a multipurpose [[dance studio]], meeting room space, and athletic department offices.  It serves as home to several of the university's athletic teams and has hosted numerous [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] regional and [[University Athletic Association]] conference championship events.

Located at the southwest corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street, the Ratner Center has an award-winning design that substitutes a complex external mast and [[counterweight]] system for interior support devices to allow for large open-space areas inside the building. Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates Inc. was credited as the design architect and OWP/P was the architect of record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risatech.com/showcase/msc/EAE2004/EAEAwards_RatnerAthleticsCenter.pdf|title=Gerald Ratner Athletics Center|accessdate=2010-05-02|work=[[Modern Steel Construction]]|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof design incorporated multi-level splayed cables so that the structural roof members could form a {{convert|33|in|cm|1|adj=on}} deep uniformly curved roof plane.
The roof members are curved and shallow.  They support 7 {{convert|2|in|cm|1|adj=on}} thick {{convert|25|ft|m|1|adj=on}} metal roof deck spans between the roof girders.  The W33x169 girders are cold bent with reverse curves to multiple radii. The curved roof planes are suspended from German “full-lock” steel cables and include three outer layers of interlocking Z-shaped wires designed to minimize water infiltration and corrosion.&lt;ref name=GRACSM/&gt;

The engineering of the masts was complicated because stability was so important to the overall design success of the suspension structure.  Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design.  The key to successful design was control of the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] settlement.  The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty [[clay]] below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure.

[[File:KMask.jpg|thumb|A kponyungo mask]]
The '''kponyungo''' is a ritual mask created by the [[Senufo people|Senufo]] people, an ethnolinguistic group residing in Africa's [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bickford|first=Kathleen E.|last2=Smith|first2=Cherise|date=1997-01-01|title=Art of the Western Sudan|jstor=4104378|journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=105–196|doi=10.2307/4104378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Kponyungo masks are spiritual items used in funeral ceremonies. In this ritual, One member from each participating Poro Organization (a secret men’s society, also referred to as a hunting society) wears a mask and will drum next to the home of the deceased or the home belonging to the deceased lineage group.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Rand African Art, Accessed February 5, 2016, http://www.randafricanart.com/Senufo_Kponyugo_painted.html .&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this ceremony is to capture the spirit of the deceased. If the spirit is allowed to roam free, it might bring the original chaos back to the Senufo people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The author of this does not claim to understand the nature of 'chaos' as it is understood by the Senufo. Regardless, this ceremony is based on the preservation of the Senufo people and culture, as they believe that the death of one member has the potential to bring about the destruction of their society.

The physical design of the mask is important to its ceremonial roles. Each mask is made differently, has different meaning to the person who crafts it, and serves different purposes within the funeral ritual depending on its physical attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The masks generally resemble the head of an antelope at its base. Antelope horns and warthog tusks are the most important and most common attribute of the masks. Occasionally, porcupine quills and ‘magic’ feathers may be inserted into the mouth and muzzle. The masks may also hold inscribed images of birds such as the African Fish Eagle, the shrike, or the hornbill, eating a chameleon attached to a cup. The cup is said to symbolize a container for magical herbs. Many of these image have unknown symbolic meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Art Institute of Chicago ==
One of these masks is owned by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and is part of the &quot;African Art and Indian Art of the Americas&quot; gallery. It is not displayed with this gallery, however, as it is also a mobile item, allowing the museum to distribute it temporarily to other institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Art Instituite of Chicago, accessed February 5, 2016, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/18759 .&lt;/ref&gt; Through 2015 and early 2016, the object traveled to the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], and the [[Musée Fabre]] in Montpellier, France.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It will be returning to Chicago's Art Institute after its time in France (March 2016). The object has an unrecorded history prior to its departure from its original location, Ivory Coast. The individuals who acquired the mask in 1963, Henri and Hélène Kamer, have never shared their experience in acquiring this particular mask. It is common, however, that these masks are sold to art dealers if the object is no longer in use (or no longer considered powerful and spiritual) by the Senufo people. This is most likely how the transaction occurred,{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} and soon thereafter the Kamers brought the mask to America and sold it to the Chicago's Art Institute in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9678">The '''University of Chicago Extension Division Library School''' was one of the pioneering training programs for librarians in the [[United States]]. The library school was a section within the Extension Division's Class-Study Department.&lt;ref name=classes&gt;&quot;University of Chicago library classes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in 1903 after receiving controversial criticisms from the [[American Library Association]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
The University of Chicago Extension Division began offering courses in “[[Library science#19th century|library economy]]” in January 1897.&lt;ref name=Grotzinger&gt;Grotzinger, 1966, p. 220-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The courses covered such topics as the history of library economy to 1870, bookbinding, and how to use libraries.&lt;ref&gt;University Extension Division, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1897-1898 school year, the program began focusing more on library work and offered three courses: &quot;The Modern Library Movement,&quot; &quot;Cataloging and Classification,&quot; and &quot;Bibliography and Reference Work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, it offered the courses &quot;Historical and Literary Outlines of Library Economy,&quot; &quot;Technical Methods,&quot; and &quot;Bibliography and Reference Work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dixson&gt;Dixson Papers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the course &quot;Principles of Library Administration&quot; was also added.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2&gt;Stauffer, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to Library Training===
By 1900, the library courses had completely transformed into a school for training librarians with [[Zella Allen Dixson]] as the instructor and director.&lt;ref name=Stauffer&gt;Stauffer, pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Students were required to have at least two years of college experience before being admitted into the program.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2/&gt; While students of any major were allowed to enroll, credits were only granted to those who were library students.&lt;ref name=Stauffer6&gt;Stauffer, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Each course met once a week for a two-hour session with the entire program taking two years to complete.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2/&gt; The school used a learn-by-doing strategy in which students worked in the university library. There were three faculty members: Dixson, cataloger Josephine Robertson, and [[Mary E. Downey]].&lt;ref name=Stauffer3&gt;Stauffer, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Robertson’s requests, the library science courses never became a degree program and instead offered only a certificate to students.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4&gt;Stauffer, pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy &amp; Closure===
The [[American Library Association]]’s [[Association of College and Research Libraries|College and Reference Library Section]] sent a letter to [[University of Chicago]] President [[William Rainey Harper]] criticizing the library school.&lt;ref name=Stauffer/&gt; The exact criticisms were that there were no entrance requirements, only 200 hours were required to complete the program, there was only one instructor (Dixson) and she was incompetent, the program did not provide the opportunity to apply the skills being taught, and the students were promised jobs that they did not receive.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Dixson denied each of these allegations and stated her belief that information about the Extension Division and the success of the library school's graduates had been suppressed from the major professional journals of the time.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; She also claimed that [[Katharine Sharp]], who had founded and directed the library school at the [[University of Illinois]] in Urbana, hated everything associated with the University of Chicago and was working with [[Melvil Dewey]] of the ALA’s College Library Section to eliminate the competition the Extension Division program created with her school.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Dixson wrote a letter to Harper reminding him that, if he decided to close down the program, it would cost the university thousands of dollars in returned tuition and cause the school’s library to lose its student workers.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Faculty member and alumna Mary E. Downey also wrote a letter defending the program. In it, she stated that she chose the University of Chicago Extension Division because it was more practical than several other library schools, including the one at the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5&gt;Stauffer, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1903, the ALA’s Committee on Library Training issued a report evaluating different library science programs. The committee consisted of the directors of six of the programs evaluated in the report, including Katharine Sharp of the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt; The report incorrectly named cataloger Josephine Robertson as the director of the University of Chicago Extension Division’s library school and the training program’s sole instructor. The report went on to state that the program’s admissions requirements were inadequate and that either three years of college or an entrance examination should be required. It also criticized the school for allowing students to only partially complete the program, saying that this policy could cause confusion among potential employers who may believe that the students are all qualified graduates.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt;

In October 1903, Harper decided to close the Extension Division's library school. The dean of the University College received many letters of protests, including one from Mary E. Downey who was acting as President of the University of Chicago Library Students Club. Downey requested the school show loyalty to its students by keeping the program open and continuing its work.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt; The letters did not dissuade Harper from closing the library school.

The '''University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center''' is a collaborative [[cancer]] research center based in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], [[Chicago]], United States. The Comprehensive Cancer Center is committed to exploring and developing innovative ways to prevent and reduce cancer's devastating effects through a collaborative research program involving 210 renowned scientists and physician scientists at or affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cancer.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Comprehensive cancer.jpg|thumb|right]]
The Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded in 1973 as the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, and, after earning its [[Comprehensive Cancer Center]] designation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1998/19980428-uccrc-comp.html&lt;/ref&gt; was renamed the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center.

The Comprehensive Cancer Center is one of 45 comprehensive cancer centers in the United States as designated by the [[National Cancer Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/cancer-centers-list.html&lt;/ref&gt; of the National Institutes of Health. In 2010, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' once again gave the UChicago cancer program high marks, ranking it #15 in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/university-of-chicago-medical-center-6431210&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cancer research center director was John Ultmann whose specialty was the diagnosis, staging and treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the development of cancer chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2000/20001024-ultmann.html&lt;/ref&gt; The director is Michelle Le Beau&lt;ref&gt;http://biomed.uchicago.edu/common/faculty/lebeau.html&lt;/ref&gt; who accepted the position in 2004. Le Beau launched and implemented a strategic plan that helped the Comprehensive Cancer Center expand the scope of its research programs, and to launch a comprehensive community engagement program to enhance public awareness about cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and the role of genetics in cancer risk. Le Beau's work has been in therapy-related cancers.

==Scientific programs==
[[File:UCCCC Knapp Center Lab.jpg|thumb|Research lab at The University of Chicago's Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery.]]

Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators are organized into six integrated scientific programs that take advantage of resources throughout the university, the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]], and other scientific and medical communities:
*Program 1: Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer
*Program 2: Hematopoiesis and Hematological Malignancies
*Program 3: Immunology and Cancer
*Program 4: Pharmacogenomics and Experimental Therapeutics
*Program 5: Advanced Imaging
*Program 6: Cancer Risk and Prevention

==Clinical trials==
The Comprehensive Cancer Center is involved in more than 300 cancer clinical trials&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.uccrc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=December 2016}} and encourages participation in the clinical trials by community oncologists and minority populations through a network of affiliated hospitals. Researchers also strive to eliminate health disparities among ethnic and social groups that compose areas surrounding the UChicago campus.

[[File:Kiar 04-25-05 9027RT.jpg|thumb|[[University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital]]]]

==Accomplishments==
The University of Chicago has been the site of extraordinary breakthroughs. Scientists are proving that transforming breakthroughs in prevention will originate from the newfound understanding of the human genome. Using systems-level science to decipher the interplay among vast networks of genes, the environment, and other factors will enable researchers to map the causes of cancer, predict cancer risks for individuals, and design personalized treatment approaches.

UChicago accomplishments include landmark prostate cancer treatment in 1939, the identification of the first chromosomal abnormality in leukemia in 1972, the 1988 discovery of the molecular mechanism by which tamoxifen blocks the effects of estrogen, and the 2008 development of a new MRI procedure that can detect early breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://cancer.uchicago.edu/about/timeline.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27571">{{Chicago School (economics)}}
{{Neoliberalism sidebar |expanded=Economics}}

The '''Chicago school of economics''' is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought]] associated with the work of the faculty at the [[University of Chicago]], some of whom have constructed and popularized its principles.

In the context of macroeconomics, it is connected to the &quot;freshwater school&quot; of macroeconomics, in contrast to the [[saltwater school (economics)|saltwater school]] based in coastal universities (notably [[Harvard University]], [[MIT]], and [[UC Berkeley]]). Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected [[Keynesianism]] in favor of [[monetarism]] until the mid-1970s, when it turned to [[new classical macroeconomics]] heavily based on the concept of [[rational expectations]]. The freshwater-saltwater distinction is largely antiquated today, as the two traditions have heavily incorporated ideas from each other. Specifically, [[New Keynesian economics]] was developed as a response to new classical economics, electing to incorporate the insight of rational expectations without giving up the traditional Keynesian focus on [[imperfect competition]] and [[sticky wages]].

Chicago economists have also left their intellectual influence in other fields, notably in pioneering [[public choice theory]] and [[law and economics]], which have led to revolutionary changes in the study of [[political science]] and law. Other economists affiliated with Chicago have made their impact in fields as diverse as [[social economics]] and [[economic history]]. Thus, there is not a clear delineation of the Chicago school of economics, a term that is more commonly used in the popular media than in academic circles.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Nonetheless, Kaufman (2010) says that the School can be generally characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Kaufman in Ross B. Emmett, ed. ''The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics'' (2010) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A deep commitment to rigorous scholarship and open academic debate, an uncompromising belief in the usefulness and insight of neoclassical price theory, and a normative position that favors and promotes economic liberalism and free markets.}}

The University of Chicago Economics department, considered one of the world's foremost economics departments, has fielded 12 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes]] laureates in economics—more than any other university (as of January 2016, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] is second at 6); and has also fielded more [[John Bates Clark Medal|John Bates Clark medalists]] in economics than any other university.

The term was coined in the 1950s to refer to economists teaching in the Economics Department at the [[University of Chicago]], and closely related academic areas at the University such as the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business|Booth School of Business]] and the [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]]. They met together in frequent intense discussions that helped set a group outlook on economic issues, based on price theory. The 1950s saw the height of popularity of the [[Keynesianism|Keynesian school of economics]], so the members of the University of Chicago were considered outside the mainstream.

Besides what is popularly known as the &quot;Chicago school&quot;, there is also an &quot;Old Chicago&quot; school of economics, consisting of an earlier generation of economists such as [[Frank Knight]], [[Henry Simons]], [[Paul Douglas]] and others. Nonetheless, these scholars had an important influence on the thought of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], most notably in the development of [[price theory]] and [[transaction cost]] economics. However, their relationship to the modern macroeconomists (the third wave of Chicago economics), led by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] and [[Eugene Fama]], is more blurred.

A further significant branching of Chicago thought was dubbed by George Stigler as &quot;Chicago political economy&quot;. Inspired by the Coasian view that institutions evolve maximize Pareto-efficiency Chicago political economy came to the surprising and controversial view that politics tends towards efficiency and that policy advice is irrelevant.

==Scholars==

===Gary Becker===
{{Main article|Gary Becker}}
Gary Becker (1930–2014) was a Nobel Prize-winner from 1992 and was known in his work for applying economic methods of thinking to other fields, such as crime, sexual relationships, slavery and drugs, assuming that people act rationally. His work was originally focused in [[labour economics|labor economics]]. His work partly inspired the popular economics book ''[[Freakonomics]]''. He is considered one of the founding fathers of Chicago political economy.&lt;ref&gt;Palda, Filip. A Better Kind of Violence: Chicago Political Economy, Public Choice, and the Quest for an Ultimately Theory of Power. Cooper-Wolfling Press. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Coase===
{{Main article|Ronald Coase|Law and economics}}
Ronald Coase (1910–2013) was the most prominent economic analyst of law and the 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]]-winner. His first major article, &quot;[[The Nature of the Firm]]&quot; (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms ([[company law|companies]], partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturges v. Bridgman 1879&quot;&gt;''Sturges v. Bridgman'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt;

His second major article, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of an 1879 London legal case about [[nuisance]] named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', in which a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours; the doctor went to court seeking an injunction against the noise produced by the sweetmaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturges v. Bridgman 1879&quot;/&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial [[Contract|bargain]] that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

So, the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugene Fama===
{{Main article|Eugene Fama|Efficient-market hypothesis}}

Eugene Fama (born 1939) is an American financial economist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 for his work on empirical asset pricing and is the seventh most highly cited economist of all time.&lt;ref&gt;https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.nbcites.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has spent all of his teaching career at the University of Chicago and is the originator of the efficient-market hypothesis, first defined in his 1965 article as market where &quot;at any point in time, the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value&quot;. The notion was further explored in his 1970 article, &quot;Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work&quot;, which brought the notion of efficient markets into the forefront of modern economic theory, and his 1991 article, &quot;Efficient Markets II&quot;.  Whilst his 1965 Ph.D. thesis, &quot;The Behavior of Stock Market Prices&quot;, showed that stock prices can be approximated by a [[random walk]] in the short-term; in later work he showed that insofar as stock prices are predictable in the long-term, it is largely due to rational time-varying risk premia which can be modelled using the [[Fama–French three-factor model]] (1993, 1996) or their updated five-factor model (2014). His work showing that the [[value premium]] can persist despite rational forecasts of future earnings&lt;ref&gt;Fama and French (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and that the performance of actively managed funds is almost entirely due to chance or exposure to risk&lt;ref&gt;Fama and French (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; are all supportive of an efficient-markets view of the world.

===Robert Fogel===
{{Main article|Robert Fogel}}
Robert Fogel (1926–2013), a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in 1993, is well known for his historical analysis and his introduction of [[New economic history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Later, in ''[[Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery]]'', he argued that slaves in the Southern states of America had a higher standard of living than the industrial proletariat of the Northern states before the [[American civil war]].

===Milton Friedman===
{{Main article|Milton Friedman|Monetarism}}
Milton Friedman (1912–2006) stands as one of the most influential economists of the late twentieth century. A student of [[Frank Knight]], he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976 for, among other things, ''A Monetary History of the United States'' (1963). Friedman argued that the [[Great Depression]] had been caused by the [[Federal Reserve]]'s policies through the 1920s, and worsened in the 1930s. Friedman argued that laissez-faire government policy is more desirable than government intervention in the economy.

{{quote|One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.|[[Milton Friedman]] Interview with Richard Heffner on The Open Mind (7 December 1975)}}

Governments should aim for a neutral monetary policy oriented toward long-run [[economic growth]], by gradual expansion of the money supply. He advocated the [[quantity theory of money]], that general prices are determined by money. Therefore, active monetary (e.g. easy credit) or fiscal (e.g. tax and spend) policy can have unintended negative effects. In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1967) Friedman wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Friedman (1967) p.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects.}}

The slogan that &quot;money matters&quot; has come to be associated with Friedman, but Friedman had also leveled harsh criticism of his ideological opponents. Referring to [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s assertion that economics unrealistically models people as &quot;lightning calculator[s] of pleasure and pain&quot;, Friedman wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Friedman (1953) [http://members.shaw.ca/compilerpress1/Anno%20Friedman%20Positive%20c.htm I,V,30]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Criticism of this type is largely beside the point unless supplemented by evidence that a hypothesis differing in one or another of these respects from the theory being criticized yields better predictions for as wide a range of phenomena.}}

===Lars Peter Hansen===
{{Main article|Lars Peter Hansen}}
Lars Peter Hansen (born 1952) is an American economist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 with Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller for their work on asset pricing. Hansen began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1981 and is the David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor of economics at the University of Chicago. Although best known for his work on the [[Generalized Method of Moments]], he is also a distinguished macroeconomist, focusing on the linkages between the financial and real sectors of the economy.

===Frank Knight===
{{Main article|Frank Knight}}
Frank Knight (1885–1972) was an early member of the University of Chicago department. His most influential work was ''Risk, Uncertainty and Profit'' (1921) from which the term [[Knightian uncertainty]] was coined. Knight's perspective was iconoclastic, and markedly different from later Chicago school thinkers. He believed that while the free market could be inefficient, government programs were even less efficient. He drew from other economic schools of thought such as [[institutional economics]] to form his own nuanced perspective.

===Robert E. Lucas===
{{Main article|Robert Lucas, Jr.}}
Robert Lucas (born 1937), who won the Nobel Prize in 1995, has dedicated his life to unwinding Keynesianism. His major contribution is the argument that [[macroeconomics]] should not be seen as a separate mode of thought from [[microeconomics]], and that analysis in both should be built on the same foundations. Lucas's works cover several topics in macroeconomics, included economic growth, asset pricing, and monetary Economics.

===Richard Posner===
{{Main article|Richard Posner}}
[[Image:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Posner]] ran a blog with [[Gary Becker]].]]
Richard Posner (born 1939) is known primarily for his work in [[law and economics]], though [[Robert Solow]] describes Posner's grasp of certain economic ideas as &quot;in some respects,... precarious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Solow |first= Robert M. |authorlink= Robert Solow |year= 2009 |title= How to Understand the Disaster |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/may/14/how-to-understand-the-disaster/ |journal= [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume= 56 |issue= 8 |accessdate= 31 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal appellate judge rather than an economist, Posner's main work, ''Economic Analysis of Law'' attempts to apply rational choice models to areas of law. He has chapters on [[tort]], contract, [[corporation]]s, [[labor law]], but also [[criminal law]], [[discrimination]] and [[family law]]. Posner goes so far as to say that:&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Posner]], ''Economic Analysis of Law'' (1998) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[the central] meaning of justice, perhaps the most common is – efficiency… [because] in a world of scarce resources waste should be regarded as immoral.}}

===Theodore Schultz and D. Gale Johnson===
{{Main article|Theodore Schultz|D. Gale Johnson}}
A group of agricultural economists led by Ted Schultz and D. Gale Johnson moved from [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] to the University of Chicago in the mid-1940s. Schultz served as the chair of economics from 1946 to 1961. He became president of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1960, retired in 1967, though he remained active at the University of Chicago until his death in 1998. Johnson served as department chair from 1971-1975 and 1980-1984 and was president of the American Economics Association in 1999. Their research in farm and [[agricultural economics]] was widely influential and attracted funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to the agricultural economics program at the University. Among the graduate students and faculty affiliated with the pair in the 1940s and 1950s were [[Clifford Hardin]], [[Zvi Griliches]], [[Marc Nerlove]], and [[George S. Tolley]].&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Daniel A. Agricultural Economics at Chicago, in David Gale Johnson, John M. Antle. The Economics of Agriculture: Papers in honor of D. Gale Johnson. University of Chicago Press, 1996 p 14-29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Schultz's was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in [[human capital theory]] and [[economic development]].

===George Stigler===
{{Main article|George Stigler}}
George Stigler (1911–1991) was tutored for his thesis by [[Frank Knight]] and won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1982. He is best known for developing the ''Economic Theory of Regulation'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Theory of Economic Regulation.&quot; (1971) Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science, no. 3, pp. 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Capture (politics)|regulatory capture]], which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them. This theory is an important component of the [[Public Choice]] field of economics. He also carried out extensive research into the [[history of economic thought]]. His 1962 article &quot;Information in the Labor Market&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See also, &quot;The Economics of Information,&quot; (1961) ''Journal of Political Economy'', June. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-3808%28196106%2969%3A3%3C213%3ATEOI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-D&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage (JSTOR)]&lt;/ref&gt; developed the theory of [[unemployment types|search unemployment]].

==Criticisms==
[[Paul Douglas]], economist and Democratic senator from Illinois for 18 years, was uncomfortable with the environment he found at the university. He stated that, &quot;…I was disconcerted to find that the economic and political conservatives had acquired almost complete dominance over my department and taught that market decisions were always right and profit values the supreme ones… The opinions of my colleagues would have confined government to the eighteenth-century functions of justice, police, and arms, which I thought had been insufficient even for that time and were certainly so for ours. These men would neither use statistical data to develop economic theory nor accept critical analysis of the economic system… (Frank) Knight was now openly hostile, and his disciples seemed to be everywhere. If I stayed, it would be in an unfriendly environment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Douglas, ''In the Fullness of Time'', 1972, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the efficacy of [[Eugene Fama]]'s [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (EMH) was debated after the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], proponents emphasized that the EMH is consistent with the large decline in asset prices since the event was unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/11/100111fa_fact_cassidy&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if market crashes never occurred, ''this'' would contradict the EMH since the average return of risky assets would be too large to justify the decreased risk of a large decline in prices; and if anything, the [[equity premium puzzle]] implies that market crashes do not happen ''enough'' to justify the high [[Sharpe ratio]] of US stocks and other risky assets.

Economist [[Brad DeLong]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] says the Chicago School has experienced an &quot;intellectual collapse&quot;, while Nobel laureate [[Paul Krugman]] of [[Princeton University]] says that some recent comments from Chicago school economists are &quot;the product of a Dark Age of macroeconomics in which hard-won knowledge has been forgotten&quot;, claiming that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s has been wrong, preferring models developed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html | work=The New York Times | title=How Did Economists Get It So Wrong? | first=Paul | last=Krugman | date=2009-09-06 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago finance economist [[John H. Cochrane|John Cochrane]] countered that these criticisms were ad hominem, displayed a &quot;deep and highly politicized ignorance of what economics and finance is really all about&quot;, and failed to disentangle bubbles from rational risk premiums and crying wolf too many times in a row, emphasizing that even if these criticisms were true, it would make a stronger argument ''against'' regulation and control.&lt;ref&gt;faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/ecaf_2077.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the school also has been criticized for training economists who advised the Chilean government (and to a lesser extent other South American governments) during the 1970s and 1980s. Whilst they were credited with transforming Chile into Latin America's best performing economy (see [[Miracle of Chile]]) with GDP per capita increasing from US$693 at the start of 1975 (the year [[Milton Friedman]] met with [[Augusto Pinochet]]; 9th highest of 12 South American countries) to $14,528 by the end of 2014 (the 2nd highest in South America),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.google.com.au/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:CHL:ARG:PER&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:CHL:ARG:PER:BRA:COL:VEN:ECU:BOL:URY:PRY:GUY:SUR&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=158763600000&amp;tend=1389531600000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false |title= World Development Indicators|date= 12 January 2016|publisher= World Bank|access-date= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics counter there was a corresponding increase in income inequality and that the reforms had a negative influence on the economic policies of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. In the years since the reforms were introduced, the economic system implemented by the &quot;[[Chicago Boys]]&quot; (a label given to this group of economists) have mostly remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2016/01/in_chicago_boys_the_story_of_chilean_economists_who_studied_in_america_and.html |title= The Boys Who Got to Remake an Economy |website= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film titled ''Chicago Boys'', which had a highly critical view of the economic reforms, was released in Chile in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123562/|title= Chicago Boys (2015) |publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
